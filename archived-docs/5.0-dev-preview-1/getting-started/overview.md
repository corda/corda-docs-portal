Before installing the Corda 5 Developer Preview, you should read the [technology overview](../../../../../en/platform/corda/5.0-dev-preview-1/getting-started/prerequisites.md).

The Corda 5 Developer Preview is intended for local deployment, experimental development, and testing only.

Included in the Corda 5 Developer Preview:

* New modular APIs.
* Corda CLI.
* Corda Node CLI.
* CorDapp Builder CLI.
* RPC libraries.
* Flow unit test library.

In addition, you can install and use the Corda 5 Developer Preview versions of the confidential identities project and Tokens SDK.

## Working with existing Corda versions

Since the Corda 5 Developer Preview requires [Azul11.0.12](https://www.azul.com/downloads/?package=jdk),
and Corda 4.x needs Java 8, you should make sure you are using the correct
version of Java when returning to Corda 4 development work after using the Corda 5 Developer Preview.

## Step-by-step installation guide

To install the Corda 5 Developer Preview:

### Install Docker
1. Install Docker version 18.06.0 or higher. You will use it to run a local Corda network.

   After installing Docker, open Docker Desktop and perform one of the following steps:
      * If you are a Mac user, go to **Preferences** and configure Docker Desktop to have at least 6GB of RAM and use 6 cores.
      * If you are a Windows user, go to **Settings > General** and select the following options: **Expose daemon on tcp://localhost:2375 without TLS** and **Use the WSL 2 based engine**.

2. Install Docker Compose using a shell such as Bash, or Git Bash for Windows.

### Get the Corda 5 Developer Preview from Maven Central
3. Get access to [Maven Central](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/net/corda/corda/5.0.0-DevPreview-1.0.1/), R3â€™s artifact management solution.

### Get the command-line interfaces (CLIs)
4. [Install the Corda CLI tool](../../../../../en/platform/corda/5.0-dev-preview-1/corda-cli/installing-corda-cli.md).

   The Corda CLI is a command-line interface that is used to deploy and help manage the Corda network and Corda package files.

5. [Download and save the Corda Node CLI](../../../../../en/platform/corda/5.0-dev-preview-1/nodes/operating/cli-curl/cli-curl.md).

   The Corda Node CLI allows you to interact with nodes using the new HTTP-RPC API. It offers a
   convenient way of calling HTTP-RPC methods, and formats their results so that they are easy to understand.

6. [Install CorDapp Builder CLI](../../../../../en/platform/corda/5.0-dev-preview-1/packaging/cordapp-builder.md) to create Corda package bundle files.

### RPC libraries
7. In the Corda 5 Developer Preview, you can expose remote procedure call (RPC) functionality via a secure HTTP API (HTTP-RPC).
   It serves the purpose of allowing interaction with a running Corda node from any HTTP client including, but not limited to,
   web browsers.

   For more information, read about [developing nodes](../../../../../en/platform/corda/5.0-dev-preview-1/nodes/developing/developing-nodes-homepage.md) and
   [operating nodes](../../../../../en/platform/corda/5.0-dev-preview-1/nodes/operating/operating-nodes-homepage.md).

### Install the Corda 5 Developer Preview versions of the confidential identities project and Tokens SDK (optional)
8. The confidential identities project and Tokens SDK work with the Corda 5 Developer Preview. To update them, read the installation guides for [the confidential identifies project](../../../../../en/platform/corda/5.0-dev-preview-1/confidential-identities/overview.html#install-the-confidential-identities-sdk) and the [Tokens SDK project](../../../../../en/platform/corda/5.0-dev-preview-1/tokens-sdk/overview.html#install-the-tokens-sdk).
