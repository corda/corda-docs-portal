# Operating Corda Enterprise

When operating a Corda Enterprise instance, there are several basic scenarios requiring attention:


## [Starting the installed components](starting-components.html)

Instructions for starting installed instances of the Corda Node, Bridge, and Float.


## [Monitoring and logging](monitoring-logging.html)

Node monitoring and logging information including development and production implementations.


## [Optimizing Node capability](optimizing.html)

Node performance optimization can be achieved by adjusting node configuration, node memory, node thread count.


## [Change management](cm-backup.html)

The three scenarios most frequently requiring change management are:


* [Backup and restoration of a Corda Node](cm-backup.html)
* [Upgrading Corda versions on a Node](cm-upgrading-node.html)
* [Updating a running CorDapp](cm-updating-cordapp.html)
