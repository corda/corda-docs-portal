# Configuration Obfuscator

Corda ships with a command-line tool for obfuscating configuration files. An obfuscated file is usable
by a Corda node running on a machine with a hardware address matching the one used as input in the obfuscation.

{{< note >}}
The purpose of this tool is to obfuscate sensitive information in configuration files and thus make a
node installation less vulnerable to someone trawling plain text files searching for passwords and
credentials of resources that they should not have access to in the first place.

{{< /note >}}

{{< warning >}}
This feature will not make password protection completely secure. However, it will protect the node
against trawling attacks.

## Using the command-line tool

The command-line tool is included as a JAR file, named `corda-tools-config-obfuscator-<version>.jar`.
This tool takes as input the configuration file that we want to obfuscate, denoted `CONFIG_FILE` in
the usage screen. If we want to override the hardware address that is used for processing, we can do so
by passing in the one to use in a hexadecimal format, where each byte is delimited by a *colon*, *e.g.*,
`01:02:03:04:05:06`. This is helpful if we want to prepare a configuration file that will be used on
a production server and to which we know the hardware address.

```bash
config-obfuscator [-hiV] [-w[=<writeToFile>]] CONFIG_FILE [HARDWARE_ADDRESS]
```


* `CONFIG_FILE` is the configuration file to obfuscate.
* `HARDWARE_ADDRESS` is the primary hardware address of the machine on
which the configuration file resides. By default, the MAC address of the
running machine will be used. Supplying `DEFAULT` will explicitly
use the default value.
* `-w=[<writeToFile>]` is a flag to indicate that the tool should write the obfuscated output to
disk, using the same file name as the input (if left blank and provided at the end of the command line),
or the provided file name.
* `-i` is a flag, which if set, says to provide input to obfuscated fields interactively.
* `-h`, `--help` is a flag used to show this help message and exit.
* `-V`, `--version` is a flag used to print version information and exit.

Note that, by default, the tool only prints out the transformed configuration to the terminal for
verification. To persist the changes, we need to use the `-w` flag, which ensures that the obfuscated
content gets written back into the provided configuration file.

The `-w` flag also takes an *optional* file name for cases where we want to write the result back to
a different file. If the optional file name is not provided, the flag needs to be provided at the end
of the command:

```bash
# Explicit output file provided
$ java -jar corda-tools-config-obfuscator-<version>.jar -w node.conf node_template.conf

# No output file provided
$ java -jar corda-tools-config-obfuscator-<version>.jar node_template.conf -w
```

Note also that `HARDWARE_ADDRESS` is optional.

{{< note >}}
The tool works on both HOCON and JSON files. Include directives (i.e. `include "other.conf"`) are not followed by the tool. If you wish to obfuscate fields in multiple files, you will need to run the tool against each file individually. The node will de-obfuscate the included files automatically.

{{< warning >}}
The Corda Enterprise Network Manager (see the CENM section on [https://docs.corda.net/](https://docs.corda.net/)) does not currently support obfuscated configurations.

## Configuration directives

To indicate parts of the configuration that should be obfuscated, we can place text markers on the form
`<encrypt{...}>`, like so:

```json
{
  // (...)
  "p2pAddress": "somehost.com:10001",
  "keyStorePassword": "<encrypt{testpassword}>",
  // (...)
}
```

Which, after having been run through the obfuscation tool, would yield something like:

```json
{
  // (...)
  "p2pAddress": "somehost.com:10001",
  "keyStorePassword": "<{8I1E8FKrBxVkRpZGZKAxKg==:oQqmyYO+SZJhRkPB7laNyQ==}>",
  // (...)
}
```

When run by a Corda node on a machine with the matching hardware address, the configuration would be
deobfuscated on the fly and interpreted like:

```json
{
  // (...)
  "p2pAddress": "somehost.com:10001",
  "keyStorePassword": "testpassword",
  // (...)
}
```

These directives can be placed arbitrarily within string properties in the configuration file, with a maximum of one per line.
For instance:

```json
{
  // (...)
  "dataSourceProperties" : {
    "dataSource" : {
      "url" : "jdbc:h2:file:persistence;<encrypt{sensitive-options-go-here}>",
      "user" : "<encrypt{your-database-username}>",
      "password" : "<encrypt{your-secret-database-password}>"
    },
    "dataSourceClassName" : "org.h2.jdbcx.JdbcDataSource"
  },
  // (...)
}
```


## Limitations


* The `<encrypt{}>` blocks can only appear inside string properties. They cannot be used to obfuscate entire
configuration blocks. Otherwise, the node will not be able to decipher the obfuscated content. More explicitly,
this means that the blocks can only appear on the right hand-side of the colon, and for string properties only
* The Configuration Obfuscator tool is only suitable for bare-metal deployments. It is not suitable for environments
where MAC addresses change regularly, such as inside Docker. In containerised environments, the ‘secrets’ service
of the container platform should be used instead, with the secrets passed in via environment variables
