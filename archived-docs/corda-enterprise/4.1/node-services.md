# Node services

This document is intended as a very brief introduction to the current
service components inside the node. Whilst not at all exhaustive it is
hoped that this will give some context when writing applications and
code that use these services, or which are operated upon by the internal
components of Corda.


## Services within the node

The node services represent the various sub functions of the Corda node.
Some are directly accessible to contracts and flows through the
`ServiceHub`, whilst others are the framework internals used to host
the node functions. Any public service interfaces are defined in the
`net.corda.core.node.services` package. The `ServiceHub` interface exposes
functionality suitable for flows.
The implementation code for all standard services lives in the `net.corda.node.services` package.

All the services are constructed in the `AbstractNode` `start`
method. They may also register a shutdown handler during initialisation,
which will be called in reverse order to the start registration sequence when the `Node.stop` is called.

The roles of the individual services are described below.


## Key management and identity services


### InMemoryIdentityService

The `InMemoryIdentityService` implements the `IdentityService`
interface and provides a store of remote mappings between `PublicKey`
and remote `Parties`. It is automatically populated from the
`NetworkMapCache` updates and is used when translating `PublicKey`
exposed in transactions into fully populated `Party` identities. This
service is also used in the default JSON mapping of parties in the web
server, thus allowing the party names to be used to refer to other nodes’
legal identities. In the future the Identity service will be made
persistent and extended to allow anonymised session keys to be used in
flows where the well-known `PublicKey` of nodes need to be hidden
to non-involved parties.


### PersistentKeyManagementService and E2ETestKeyManagementService

Typical usage of these services is to locate an appropriate
`PrivateKey` to complete and sign a verified transaction as part of a
flow. The normal node legal identifier keys are typically accessed via
helper extension methods on the `ServiceHub`, but these ultimately delegate
signing to internal `PrivateKeys` from the `KeyManagementService`. The
`KeyManagementService` interface also allows other keys to be
generated if anonymous keys are needed in a flow. Note that this
interface works at the level of individual `PublicKey` and internally
matched `PrivateKey` pairs, but the signing authority may be represented by a
``CompositeKey` on the `NodeInfo` to allow key clustering and
threshold schemes.

The `PersistentKeyManagementService` is a persistent implementation of
the `KeyManagementService` interface that records the key pairs to a
key-value storage table in the database. `E2ETestKeyManagementService`
is a simple implementation of the `KeyManagementService` that is used
to track our `KeyPairs` for use in unit testing when no database is
available.


## Messaging and network management services


### ArtemisMessagingServer

The `ArtemisMessagingServer` service is run internally by the Corda
node to host the `ArtemisMQ` messaging broker that is used for
reliable node communications. Although the node can be configured to
disable this and connect to a remote broker by setting the
`messagingServerAddress` configuration to be the remote broker
address. (The `MockNode` used during testing does not use this
service, and has a simplified in-memory network layer instead.) This
service is not exposed to any CorDapp code as it is an entirely internal
infrastructural component. However, the developer may need to be aware
of this component, because the `ArtemisMessagingServer` is responsible
for configuring the network ports (based upon settings in `node.conf`)
and the service configures the security settings of the `ArtemisMQ`
middleware and acts to form bridges between node mailbox queues based
upon connection details advertised by the `NetworkMapCache`. The
`ArtemisMQ` broker is configured to use TLS1.2 with a custom
`TrustStore` containing a Corda root certificate and a `KeyStore`
with a certificate and key signed by a chain back to this root
certificate. These keystores typically reside in the `certificates`
sub folder of the node workspace. For the nodes to be able to connect to
each other it is essential that the entire set of nodes are able to
authenticate against each other and thus typically that they share a
common root certificate. Also note that the address configuration
defined for the server is the basis for the address advertised in the
`NetworkMapCache` and thus must be externally connectable by all nodes
in the network.


### P2PMessagingClient

The `P2PMessagingClient` is the implementation of the
`MessagingService` interface operating across the `ArtemisMQ`
middleware layer. It typically connects to the local `ArtemisMQ`
hosted within the `ArtemisMessagingServer` service. However, the
`messagingServerAddress` configuration can be set to a remote broker
address if required. The responsibilities of this service include
managing the node’s persistent mailbox, sending messages to remote peer
nodes, acknowledging properly consumed messages and deduplicating any
resent messages. The service also handles the incoming requests from new
RPC client sessions and hands them to the `CordaRPCOpsImpl` to carry
out the requests.


### InMemoryNetworkMapCache

The `InMemoryNetworkMapCache` implements the `NetworkMapCache`
interface and is responsible for tracking the identities and advertised
services of authorised nodes provided by the remote
`NetworkMapService`. Typical use is to search for nodes hosting
specific advertised services e.g. a Notary service, or an Oracle
service. Also, this service allows mapping of friendly names, or
`Party` identities to the full `NodeInfo` which is used in the
`StateMachineManager` to convert between the `PublicKey`, or
`Party` based addressing used in the flows/contracts and the
physical host and port information required for the physical
`ArtemisMQ` messaging layer.


## Storage and persistence related services


### DBCheckpointStorage

The `DBCheckpointStorage` service is used from within the
`StateMachineManager` code to persist the progress of flows. Thus
ensuring that if the program terminates the flow can be restarted
from the same point and complete the flow. This service should not
be used by any CorDapp components.


### DBTransactionMappingStorage and InMemoryStateMachineRecordedTransactionMappingStorage

The `DBTransactionMappingStorage` is used within the
`StateMachineManager` code to relate transactions and flows. This
relationship is exposed in the eventing interface to the RPC clients,
thus allowing them to track the end result of a flow and map to the
actual transactions/states completed. Otherwise this service is unlikely
to be accessed by any CorDapps. The
`InMemoryStateMachineRecordedTransactionMappingStorage` service is
available as a non-persistent implementation for unit tests with no database.


### DBTransactionStorage

The `DBTransactionStorage` service is a persistent implementation of
the `TransactionStorage` interface and allows flows read-only
access to full transactions, plus transaction level event callbacks.
Storage of new transactions must be made via the `recordTransactions`
method on the `ServiceHub`, not via a direct call to this service, so
that the various event notifications can occur.


### NodeAttachmentService

The `NodeAttachmentService` provides an implementation of the
`AttachmentStorage` interface exposed on the `ServiceHub` allowing
transactions to add documents, copies of the contract code and binary
data to transactions. The service is also interfaced to by the web server,
which allows files to be uploaded via an HTTP post request.


## Flow framework and event scheduling services


### StateMachineManager

The `StateMachineManager` is the service that runs the active
flows of the node whether initiated by an RPC client, the web
interface, a scheduled state activity, or triggered by receipt of a
message from another node. The `StateMachineManager` wraps the
flow code (extensions of the `FlowLogic` class) inside an
instance of the `FlowStateMachineImpl` class, which is a
`Quasar` `Fiber`. This allows the `StateMachineManager` to suspend
flows at all key lifecycle points and persist their serialized state
to the database via the `DBCheckpointStorage` service. This process
uses the facilities of the `Quasar` `Fibers` library to manage this
process and hence the requirement for the node to run the `Quasar`
java instrumentation agent in its JVM.

In operation the `StateMachineManager` is typically running an active
flow on its server thread until it encounters a blocking, or
externally visible operation, such as sending a message, waiting for a
message, or initiating a `subFlow`. The fiber is then suspended
and its stack frames serialized to the database, thus ensuring that if
the node is stopped, or crashes at this point the flow will restart
with exactly the same action again. To further ensure consistency, every
event which resumes a flow opens a database transaction, which is
committed during this suspension process ensuring that the database
modifications e.g. state commits stay in sync with the mutating changes
of the flow. Having recorded the fiber state the
`StateMachineManager` then carries out the network actions as required
(internally one flow message exchanged may actually involve several
physical session messages to authenticate and invoke registered
flows on the remote nodes). The flow will stay suspended until
the required message is returned and the scheduler will resume
processing of other activated flows. On receipt of the expected
response message from the network layer the `StateMachineManager`
locates the appropriate flow, resuming it immediately after the
blocking step with the received message. Thus from the perspective of
the flow the code executes as a simple linear progression of
processing, even if there were node restarts and possibly message
resends (the messaging layer deduplicates messages based on an id that
is part of the checkpoint).

The `StateMachineManager` service is not directly exposed to the
flows, or contracts themselves.


### NodeSchedulerService

The `NodeSchedulerService` implements the `SchedulerService`
interface and monitors the Vault updates to track any new states that
implement the `SchedulableState` interface and require automatic
scheduled flow initiation. At the scheduled due time the
`NodeSchedulerService` will create a new flow instance passing it
a reference to the state that triggered the event. The flow can then
begin whatever action is required. Note that the scheduled activity
occurs in all nodes holding the state in their Vault, it may therefore
be required for the flow to exit early if the current node is not
the intended initiator.


## Vault related services


### NodeVaultService

The `NodeVaultService` implements the `VaultService` interface to
allow access to the node’s own set of unconsumed states. The service
does this by tracking update notifications from the
`TransactionStorage` service and processing relevant updates to delete
consumed states and insert new states. The resulting update is then
persisted to the database. The `VaultService` then exposes query and
event notification APIs to flows and CorDapp services to allow them
to respond to updates, or query for states meeting various conditions to
begin the formation of new transactions consuming them. The equivalent
services are also forwarded to RPC clients, so that they may show
updating views of states held by the node.


### NodeSchemaService and HibernateObserver

The `HibernateObserver` runs within the node framework and listens for
vault state updates, the `HibernateObserver` then uses the mapping
services of the `NodeSchemaService` to record the states in auxiliary
database tables. This allows Corda state updates to be exposed to
external legacy systems by insertion of unpacked data into existing
tables. To enable these features the contract state must implement the
`QueryableState` interface to define the mappings.


## Corda Web Server

A simple web server is provided that embeds the Jetty servlet container.
The Corda web server is not meant to be used for real, production-quality
web apps. Instead it shows one example way of using Corda RPC in web apps
to provide a REST API on top of the Corda native RPC mechanism.
