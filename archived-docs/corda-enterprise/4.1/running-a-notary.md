# Setting up a notary service

Corda Enterprise comes with two notary implementations built-in:

1. **Single-node**: a simple notary service that persists notarisation requests in the node's database. It is easy to configure
   and can be used for testing, or networks that do not have strict availability requirements.
2. **Highly available**: a clustered notary service operated by a single party, able to tolerate crash faults.

## Single-node

To have a regular Corda node provide a notary service you simply need to set appropriate ``notary`` configuration values
before starting it:

```
notary : { validating : false }
```

For a validating notary service specify:

```
notary : { validating : true }
```

For clients to be able to use the notary service, its identity must be added to the network parameters. This will be
done automatically when creating the network, if using [Network Bootstrapper](network-bootstrapper.md). See [Networks](corda-networks-index.md)
for more details.

## Highly available

Corda Enterprise provides a highly available notary service implementation backed by a replicated Percona XtraDB cluster.
This is the recommended implementation for production networks. See [running a notary cluster](running-a-notary-cluster/toctree.md) for detailed
setup steps.

{{< warning >}}
Upgrading an existing single-node notary to be highly available is currently unsupported.
