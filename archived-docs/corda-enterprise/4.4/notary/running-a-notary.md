# Setting up a notary service

Corda Enterprise comes with two notary implementations built-in:


* **Single-node**: a simple notary service that persists notarisation requests in the nodeâ€™s database. It is easy to configure
and can be used for testing, or networks that do not have strict availability requirements.
* **Highly available**: a clustered notary service operated by a single party, able to tolerate crash faults.


{{< warning >}}
Upgrading an existing single-node notary to be highly available is currently unsupported.

## Single-node notary

To have a regular Corda node provide a notary service you simply need to set appropriate `notary` configuration values
before starting it:

```kotlin
notary : { validating : false }
```

For a validating notary service specify:

```kotlin
notary : { validating : true }
```

For clients to be able to use the notary service, its identity must be added to the network parameters. This will be
done automatically when creating the network, if using [Network Bootstrapper](../network-bootstrapper.md).
