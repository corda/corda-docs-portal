# Building Corda

These instructions are for downloading and building the Corda code locally. If you only wish to develop CorDapps for
use on Corda, you don’t need to do this, follow the instructions at [Getting set up for CorDapp development](getting-set-up.md) and use the precompiled binaries.


## Windows


### Java


* Visit [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
* Scroll down to “Java SE Development Kit 8uXXX” (where “XXX” is the latest minor version number)
* Toggle “Accept License Agreement”
* Click the download link for jdk-8uXXX-windows-x64.exe (where “XXX” is the latest minor version number)
* Download and run the executable to install Java (use the default settings)
* Add Java to the PATH environment variable by following the instructions at [https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/webnotes/install/windows/jdk-installation-windows.html#path](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/webnotes/install/windows/jdk-installation-windows.html#path)
