<p>A default value, that will be used by the Ledger Recovery flows to set how far back in time to
consider for recovery. The expectation is that a node will restore to a database backup that is no older than this, by default, when
attempting a recovery. This value can be overridden by specifying an override to the flow. It can also be overridden if the same parameter
is specified, per-node in the node configuration. An override to the flow takes priority in terms of overrides. It is optional in both
the network parameters and the node configuration however if no values are set then it needs to be specified in the flow.</p>
