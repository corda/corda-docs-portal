<h1>Lifecycle</h1>
<code><span class="keyword">enum</span> <span class="keyword">class </span><span class="identifier">Lifecycle</span></code>
<p>Represents where in its lifecycle a contract state is, which in turn controls the commands that can be applied
to the state. Most states will not leave the <a href="-n-o-r-m-a-l.html">NORMAL</a> lifecycle. Note that settled (as an end lifecycle) is
represented by absence of the state on transaction output.</p>
<h3>Enum Values</h3>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<h4><a href="-n-o-r-m-a-l.html">NORMAL</a></h4>
</td>
<td>
<p>Default lifecycle state for a contract, in which it can be settled normally</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<h4><a href="-d-e-f-a-u-l-t-e-d.html">DEFAULTED</a></h4>
</td>
<td>
<p>Indicates the contract has not been settled by its due date. Once in the defaulted state,
it can only be reverted to <a href="-n-o-r-m-a-l.html">NORMAL</a> state by the beneficiary.</p>
