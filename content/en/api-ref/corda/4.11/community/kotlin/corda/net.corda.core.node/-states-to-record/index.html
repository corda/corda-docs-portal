<h1>StatesToRecord</h1>
<code><span class="keyword">enum</span> <span class="keyword">class </span><span class="identifier">StatesToRecord</span></code>
<p>Controls whether the transaction is sent to the vault at all, and if so whether states have to be relevant
or not in order to be recorded. Used in <a href="../-service-hub/record-transactions.html">ServiceHub.recordTransactions</a></p>
<h3>Enum Values</h3>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<h4><a href="-n-o-n-e.html">NONE</a></h4>
</td>
<td>
<p>The received transaction is not sent to the vault at all. This is used within transaction resolution.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<h4><a href="-a-l-l_-v-i-s-i-b-l-e.html">ALL_VISIBLE</a></h4>
</td>
<td>
<p>All states that can be seen in the transaction will be recorded by the vault, even if none of the identities
on this node are a participant or owner.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<h4><a href="-o-n-l-y_-r-e-l-e-v-a-n-t.html">ONLY_RELEVANT</a></h4>
</td>
<td>
<p>Only states that involve one of our public keys will be stored in the vault. This is the default. A public
key is involved (relevant) if it's in the <a href="../../net.corda.core.contracts/-ownable-state/owner.html">OwnableState.owner</a> field, or appears in the <a href="../../net.corda.core.contracts/-contract-state/participants.html">ContractState.participants</a>
collection. This is usually equivalent to "can I change the contents of this state by signing a transaction".</p>
