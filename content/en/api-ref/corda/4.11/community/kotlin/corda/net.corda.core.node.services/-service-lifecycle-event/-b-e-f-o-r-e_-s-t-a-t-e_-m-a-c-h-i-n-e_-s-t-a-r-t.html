<p>This event is dispatched when the node is about to start the State Machine. The State Machine will not be started until
all handlers return from processing this event.
Handlers can delay the node start-up, and the processing of flows, by not returning from handling this event until their
CorDapp is ready for flows to be started/resumed.</p>
<p>If a handler for this event throws <a href="../-corda-service-critical-failure-exception/index.html">CordaServiceCriticalFailureException</a> - this is the way to flag that it will not make
sense for Corda node to continue its operation. The lifecycle events dispatcher will endeavor to terminate node's JVM as soon
as practically possible.</p>
