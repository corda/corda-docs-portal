<p>An interval on the time-line; not a single instantaneous point.</p>
<p>There is no such thing as <em>exact</em> time in networked systems due to the underlying physics involved and other issues
such as network latency. The best that can be approximated is "fuzzy time" or an instant of time which has margin of
tolerance around it. This is what <a href="index.html">TimeWindow</a> represents. Time windows can be open-ended (i.e. specify only one of
<a href="from-time.html">fromTime</a> and <a href="until-time.html">untilTime</a>) or they can be fully bounded.</p>
<p><a href="../../net.corda.core.transactions/-wire-transaction/index.html">WireTransaction</a> has an optional time-window property, which if specified, restricts the validity of the transaction
to that time-interval as the Consensus Service will not sign it if it's received outside of this window.</p>
