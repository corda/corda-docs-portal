<p>An asset transaction may split and merge assets represented by a set of (issuer, depositRef) pairs, across multiple
input and output states. Imagine a Bitcoin transaction but in which all UTXOs had a colour (a blend of
issuer+depositRef) and you couldn't merge outputs of two colours together, but you COULD put them in the same
transaction.</p>
<p>The goal of this design is to ensure that assets can be withdrawn from the ledger easily: if you receive some asset
via this contract, you always know where to go in order to extract it from the R3 ledger, no matter how many hands
it has passed through in the intervening time.</p>
<p>At the same time, other contracts that just want assets and don't care much who is currently holding it can ignore
the issuer/depositRefs and just examine the amount fields.</p>
