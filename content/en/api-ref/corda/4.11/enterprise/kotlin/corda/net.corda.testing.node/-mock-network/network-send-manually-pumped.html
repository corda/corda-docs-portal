<p>If false then messages will not be routed from sender to receiver until you use
the <a href="run-network.html">MockNetwork.runNetwork</a> method. This is useful for writing single-threaded unit test code that can examine the
state of the mock network before and after a message is sent, without races and without the receiving node immediately
sending a response. The default is false, so you must call runNetwork.</p>
