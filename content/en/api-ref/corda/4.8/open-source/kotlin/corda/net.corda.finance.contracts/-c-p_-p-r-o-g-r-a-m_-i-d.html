<p>This is an ultra-trivial implementation of commercial paper, which is essentially a simpler version of a corporate
bond. It can be seen as a company-specific currency. A company issues CP with a particular face value, say $100,
but sells it for less, say $90. The paper can be redeemed for cash at a given date in the future. Thus this example
would have a 10% interest rate with a single repayment. Commercial paper is often rolled over (the maturity date
is adjusted as if the paper was redeemed and immediately repurchased, but without having to front the cash).</p>
<p>This contract is not intended to realistically model CP. It is here only to act as a next step up above cash in
the prototyping phase. It is thus very incomplete.</p>
<p>Open issues:</p>
<ul><li>In this model, you cannot merge or split CP. Can you do this normally? We could model CP as a specialised form
    of cash, or reuse some of the cash code? Waiting on response from Ayoub and Rajar about whether CP can always
    be split/merged or only in secondary markets. Even if current systems can't do this, would it be a desirable
    feature to have anyway?</li>
<li>The funding steps of CP is totally ignored in this model.</li>
<li>No attention is paid to the existing roles of custodians, funding banks, etc.</li>
<li>There are regional variations on the CP concept, for instance, American CP requires a special "CUSIP number"
    which may need to be tracked. That, in turn, requires validation logic (there is a bean validator that knows how
    to do this in the Apache BVal project).</li>
</ul>
