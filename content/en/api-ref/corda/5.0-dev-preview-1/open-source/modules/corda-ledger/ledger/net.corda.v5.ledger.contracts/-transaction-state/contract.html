<p>The contract class name that will verify this state that will be created via reflection. The attachment containing this
class will be automatically added to the transaction at transaction creation time.</p>
<p>Currently these are loaded from the classpath of the node which includes the cordapp directory - at some point these will also be loaded
and run from the attachment store directly, allowing contracts to be sent across, and run, from the network from within a sandbox
environment.</p>
