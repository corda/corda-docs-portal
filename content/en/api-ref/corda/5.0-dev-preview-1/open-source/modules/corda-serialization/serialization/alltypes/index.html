<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<h5><a href="../net.corda.v5.serialization/-checkpoint-custom-serializer/index.html">net.corda.v5.serialization.CheckpointCustomSerializer</a></h5>
<p>Allows CorDapps to provide custom serializers for classes that do not serialize successfully during a checkpoint.
In this case, a proxy serializer can be written that implements this interface whose purpose is to move between
unserializable types and an intermediate representation.</p>
</tr>
<tr>
<h5><a href="../net.corda.v5.serialization/-class-whitelist/index.html">net.corda.v5.serialization.ClassWhitelist</a></h5>
</tr>
<tr>
<h5><a href="../net.corda.v5.serialization.annotations/-constructor-for-deserialization/index.html">net.corda.v5.serialization.annotations.ConstructorForDeserialization</a></h5>
<p>Annotation indicating a constructor to be used to reconstruct instances of a class during deserialization.</p>
</tr>
<tr>
<h5><a href="../net.corda.v5.serialization/-context-property-keys/index.html">net.corda.v5.serialization.ContextPropertyKeys</a></h5>
<p>Set of well known properties that may be set on a serialization context. This doesn't preclude
others being set that aren't keyed on this enumeration, but for general use properties adding a
well known key here is preferred.</p>
</tr>
<tr>
<h5><a href="../net.corda.v5.serialization.annotations/-corda-serialization-transform-enum-default/index.html">net.corda.v5.serialization.annotations.CordaSerializationTransformEnumDefault</a></h5>
<p>This annotation is used to mark an enumerated type as having had a new constant appended to it. For
each additional constant added a new annotation should be appended to the class. If more than one
is required the wrapper annotation <a href="../net.corda.v5.serialization.annotations/-corda-serialization-transform-enum-defaults/index.html">CordaSerializationTransformEnumDefaults</a> should be used to
encapsulate them</p>
</tr>
<tr>
<h5><a href="../net.corda.v5.serialization.annotations/-corda-serialization-transform-enum-defaults/index.html">net.corda.v5.serialization.annotations.CordaSerializationTransformEnumDefaults</a></h5>
<p>This annotation is used to mark an enumerated type as having had multiple members added, It acts
as a container annotation for instances of <a href="../net.corda.v5.serialization.annotations/-corda-serialization-transform-enum-default/index.html">CordaSerializationTransformEnumDefault</a>, each of which
details individual additions.</p>
</tr>
<tr>
<h5><a href="../net.corda.v5.serialization.annotations/-corda-serialization-transform-rename/index.html">net.corda.v5.serialization.annotations.CordaSerializationTransformRename</a></h5>
<p>This annotation is used to mark a class has having had a property element. It is used by the
AMQP deserializer to allow instances with different versions of the class on their Class Path
to successfully deserialize the object.</p>
</tr>
<tr>
<h5><a href="../net.corda.v5.serialization.annotations/-corda-serialization-transform-renames/index.html">net.corda.v5.serialization.annotations.CordaSerializationTransformRenames</a></h5>
<p>This annotation is used to mark a class as having had multiple elements renamed as a container annotation for
instances of <a href="../net.corda.v5.serialization.annotations/-corda-serialization-transform-rename/index.html">CordaSerializationTransformRename</a>, each of which details an individual rename.</p>
</tr>
<tr>
<h5><a href="../net.corda.v5.serialization.annotations/-deprecated-constructor-for-deserialization/index.html">net.corda.v5.serialization.annotations.DeprecatedConstructorForDeserialization</a></h5>
<p>This annotation is a marker to indicate which secondary constructors should be considered, and in which
order, for evolving objects during their deserialization.</p>
</tr>
<tr>
<h5><a href="../net.corda.v5.serialization/-encoding-whitelist/index.html">net.corda.v5.serialization.EncodingWhitelist</a></h5>
</tr>
<tr>
<h5><a href="../net.corda.v5.serialization/-missing-serializer-exception/index.html">net.corda.v5.serialization.MissingSerializerException</a></h5>
<p>Thrown by the serialization framework, probably indicating that a custom serializer
needs to be included in a transaction.</p>

</tr>
<tr>
<h5><a href="../net.corda.v5.serialization/-serialization-context/index.html">net.corda.v5.serialization.SerializationContext</a></h5>
<p>Parameters to serialization and deserialization.</p>
</tr>
<tr>
<h5><a href="../net.corda.v5.serialization/-serialization-custom-serializer/index.html">net.corda.v5.serialization.SerializationCustomSerializer</a></h5>
<p>Allows CorDapps to provide custom serializers for third party libraries where those libraries cannot
be recompiled with the -parameters flag rendering their classes natively serializable by Corda. In this case
a proxy serializer can be written that extends this type whose purpose is to move between those an
unserializable types and an intermediate representation.</p>
</tr>
<tr>
<h5><a href="../net.corda.v5.serialization/-serialization-encoding.html">net.corda.v5.serialization.SerializationEncoding</a></h5>
</tr>
<tr>
<h5><a href="../net.corda.v5.serialization/-serialization-factory/index.html">net.corda.v5.serialization.SerializationFactory</a></h5>
<p>An abstraction for serializing and deserializing objects, with support for versioning of the wire format via
a header / prefix in the bytes.</p>
</tr>

<h5><a href="../net.corda.v5.serialization/-serialization-magic.html">net.corda.v5.serialization.SerializationMagic</a></h5>
</tr>
<tr>
<h5><a href="../net.corda.v5.serialization/-serialization-token/index.html">net.corda.v5.serialization.SerializationToken</a></h5>
<p>This represents a token in the serialized stream for an instance of a type that implements <a href="../net.corda.v5.serialization/-serialize-as-token/index.html">SerializeAsToken</a>.</p>
</tr>
<tr>
<h5><a href="../net.corda.v5.serialization/-serialization-whitelist/index.html">net.corda.v5.serialization.SerializationWhitelist</a></h5>
<p>Provide a subclass of this via the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/ServiceLoader.html">java.util.ServiceLoader</a> mechanism to be able to whitelist types for
serialisation that you cannot otherwise annotate. The name of the class must appear in a text file on the
classpath under the path META-INF/services/net.corda.core.serialization.SerializationWhitelist</p>
</tr>
<tr>
<h5><a href="../net.corda.v5.serialization/-serialize-as-token/index.html">net.corda.v5.serialization.SerializeAsToken</a></h5>
<p>This interface should be implemented by classes that want to substitute a token representation of themselves if
they are serialized because they have a lot of internal state that does not serialize (well).</p>
</tr>
<tr>
<h5><a href="../net.corda.v5.serialization/-serialize-as-token-context/index.html">net.corda.v5.serialization.SerializeAsTokenContext</a></h5>
<p>A context for mapping SerializationTokens to/from SerializeAsTokens.</p>
</tr>
<tr>
<h5><a href="../net.corda.v5.serialization/-serialized-bytes/index.html">net.corda.v5.serialization.SerializedBytes</a></h5>
<p>A type safe wrapper around a byte array that contains a serialised object. You can call <a href="#">SerializedBytes.deserialize</a>
to get the original object back.</p>
</tr>
<tr>
<h5><a href="../net.corda.v5.serialization/-singleton-serialization-token/index.html">net.corda.v5.serialization.SingletonSerializationToken</a></h5>
<p>A class representing a <a href="../net.corda.v5.serialization/-serialization-token/index.html">SerializationToken</a> for some object that is not serializable but can be looked up
(when deserialized) via just the class name.</p>
</tr>
<tr>
<h5><a href="../net.corda.v5.serialization/-singleton-serialize-as-token/index.html">net.corda.v5.serialization.SingletonSerializeAsToken</a></h5>
<p>This interface should be implemented by classes that want to substitute a singleton token representation of themselves if they are
serialized because they have a lot of internal state that does not serialize (well).</p>
