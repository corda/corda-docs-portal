<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<h5><a href="../net.corda.systemflows/-abstract-state-replacement-flow/index.html">net.corda.systemflows.AbstractStateReplacementFlow</a></h5>
<p>Abstract flow to be used for replacing one state with another, for example when changing the notary of a state.
Notably this requires a one to one replacement of states, states cannot be split, merged or issued as part of these
flows.</p>
</tr>
<tr>
<h5><a href="../net.corda.systemflows/-collect-signature-flow/index.html">net.corda.systemflows.CollectSignatureFlow</a></h5>
<p>Get and check the required signature.</p>
</tr>
<tr>
<h5><a href="../net.corda.systemflows/-collect-signatures-flow/index.html">net.corda.systemflows.CollectSignaturesFlow</a></h5>
<p>The <a href="../net.corda.systemflows/-collect-signatures-flow/index.html">CollectSignaturesFlow</a> is used to automate the collection of counterparty signatures for a given transaction.</p>
</tr>
<tr>
<h5><a href="../net.corda.systemflows/-finality-flow/index.html">net.corda.systemflows.FinalityFlow</a></h5>
<p>Verifies the given transaction, then sends it to the named notary. If the notary agrees that the transaction is acceptable then it is
from that point onwards committed to the ledger, and will be written through to the vault. Additionally it will be distributed to the
parties reflected in the participants list of the states.</p>
</tr>
<tr>
<h5><a href="../net.corda.systemflows/-notary-change-flow/index.html">net.corda.systemflows.NotaryChangeFlow</a></h5>
<p>A flow to be used for changing a state's Notary. This is required since all input states to a transaction
must point to the same notary.</p>
</tr>
<tr>
<h5><a href="../net.corda.systemflows/-notary-client-flow/index.html">net.corda.systemflows.NotaryClientFlow</a></h5>
<p>A flow to be used by a party for obtaining signature(s) from a <a href="#">NotaryService</a> ascertaining the transaction
time-window is correct and none of its inputs have been used in another completed transaction.</p>
</tr>
<tr>
<h5><a href="../net.corda.systemflows/-receive-finality-flow/index.html">net.corda.systemflows.ReceiveFinalityFlow</a></h5>
<p>The receiving counterpart to <a href="../net.corda.systemflows/-finality-flow/index.html">FinalityFlow</a>.</p>
</tr>
<tr>
<h5><a href="../net.corda.systemflows/-receive-state-and-ref-flow/index.html">net.corda.systemflows.ReceiveStateAndRefFlow</a></h5>
<p>The <a href="../net.corda.systemflows/-receive-state-and-ref-flow/index.html">ReceiveStateAndRefFlow</a> should be called in response to the <a href="../net.corda.systemflows/-send-state-and-ref-flow/index.html">SendStateAndRefFlow</a>.</p>

<tr>
<h5><a href="../net.corda.systemflows/-receive-transaction-flow/index.html">net.corda.systemflows.ReceiveTransactionFlow</a></h5>
<p>The <a href="../net.corda.systemflows/-receive-transaction-flow/index.html">ReceiveTransactionFlow</a> should be called in response to the <a href="../net.corda.systemflows/-send-transaction-flow/index.html">SendTransactionFlow</a>.</p>
</tr>
<tr>
<h5><a href="../net.corda.systemflows/-send-state-and-ref-flow/index.html">net.corda.systemflows.SendStateAndRefFlow</a></h5>
<p>The <a href="../net.corda.systemflows/-send-state-and-ref-flow/index.html">SendStateAndRefFlow</a> should be used to send a list of input <a href="#">StateAndRef</a> to another peer that wishes to verify
the input's integrity by resolving and checking the dependencies as well. The other side should invoke <a href="../net.corda.systemflows/-receive-state-and-ref-flow/index.html">ReceiveStateAndRefFlow</a>
at the right point in the conversation to receive the input state and ref and perform the resolution back-and-forth
required to check the dependencies.</p>
</tr>
<tr>
<h5><a href="../net.corda.systemflows/-send-transaction-flow/index.html">net.corda.systemflows.SendTransactionFlow</a></h5>
<p>The <a href="../net.corda.systemflows/-send-transaction-flow/index.html">SendTransactionFlow</a> should be used to send a transaction to another peer that wishes to verify that transaction's
integrity by resolving and checking the dependencies as well. The other side should invoke <a href="../net.corda.systemflows/-receive-transaction-flow/index.html">ReceiveTransactionFlow</a> at
the right point in the conversation to receive the sent transaction and perform the resolution back-and-forth required
to check the dependencies and download any missing attachments.</p>
</tr>
<tr>
<h5><a href="../net.corda.systemflows/-sign-transaction-flow/index.html">net.corda.systemflows.SignTransactionFlow</a></h5>
<p>The <a href="../net.corda.systemflows/-sign-transaction-flow/index.html">SignTransactionFlow</a> should be called in response to the <a href="../net.corda.systemflows/-collect-signatures-flow/index.html">CollectSignaturesFlow</a>. It automates the signing of
a transaction providing the transaction:</p>

<tr>
<h5><a href="../net.corda.systemflows/-with-referenced-states-flow/index.html">net.corda.systemflows.WithReferencedStatesFlow</a></h5>
<p>Given a flow which uses reference states, the <a href="../net.corda.systemflows/-with-referenced-states-flow/index.html">WithReferencedStatesFlow</a> will execute the flow as a subFlow.
If the flow fails due to a <a href="#">NotaryError.Conflict</a> for a reference state, then WithReferencedStatesFlow will be suspended until the
state refs for the reference states are consumed. In this case, a consumption means that:</p>
