<h1>CordaService</h1>
<code><span class="keyword">interface </span><span class="identifier">CordaService</span>&nbsp;<span class="symbol">:</span>&nbsp;<a href="../net.corda.v5.application.services.lifecycle/-service-lifecycle-observer/index.html"><span class="identifier">ServiceLifecycleObserver</span></a><span class="symbol">, </span><span class="identifier">SingletonSerializeAsToken</span></code>
<p>Any class that needs to be a long-lived service within the node, should implement this interface. The constructor will be invoked during
node start to initialise the service, however initialisation logic is better added to the <a href="../net.corda.v5.application.services.lifecycle/-service-lifecycle-observer/on-event.html">ServiceLifecycleObserver.onEvent</a> function as
a response to the <a href="../net.corda.v5.application.services.lifecycle/-service-start.html">ServiceStart</a> implementation of <a href="../net.corda.v5.application.services.lifecycle/-service-lifecycle-event.html">ServiceLifecycleEvent</a> so that injected services can be used. Injected services are
injected post instantiation so no injected services can be used within a constructor. Corda services are created as singletons within the
node and can be made available to flows and other corda services via dependency injection.</p>
<p>All corda services can become available for injection to flows or corda services by additionally implementing <a href="../net.corda.v5.application.injection/-corda-flow-injectable.html">CordaFlowInjectable</a> or
<a href="../net.corda.v5.application.injection/-corda-service-injectable.html">CordaServiceInjectable</a> respectively or both. They can be injected into flows, other corda services, or notary services by using the
<a href="../net.corda.v5.application.injection/-corda-inject/index.html">CordaInject</a> or <a href="../net.corda.v5.application.injection/-corda-inject-pre-start/index.html">CordaInjectPreStart</a> annotations. Dependencies annotated with <a href="../net.corda.v5.application.injection/-corda-inject-pre-start/index.html">CordaInjectPreStart</a> will be made available for use
before the <a href="../net.corda.v5.application.services.lifecycle/-service-start.html">ServiceStart</a> lifecycle event is distributed, whereas <a href="../net.corda.v5.application.injection/-corda-inject/index.html">CordaInject</a> dependencies will be injected after the service has
started.</p>
