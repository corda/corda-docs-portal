<p>This event is dispatched once all corda services have been instantiated and registered as injectable services.</p>
<p>Any logic required to start the service should be added in response to this event. Services are ordered based on their usages of
<a href="../net.corda.v5.application.injection/-corda-inject-pre-start/index.html">CordaInjectPreStart</a> such that all <a href="../net.corda.v5.application.injection/-corda-inject-pre-start/index.html">CordaInjectPreStart</a> annotated services have this event distributed to them before the parent
service, which annotated the previously mentioned services, receives notification of this event. This event is then distributed to
the remaining services which are not using the <a href="../net.corda.v5.application.injection/-corda-inject-pre-start/index.html">CordaInjectPreStart</a> annotation.</p>
