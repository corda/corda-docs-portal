<p>Invokes the given subflow. This function returns once the subflow completes successfully with the result
returned by that subflow's <a href="../../net.corda.v5.application.flows/-flow/call.html">Flow.call</a> method. If the subflow has a progress tracker, it is attached to the
current step in this flow's progress tracker.</p>
<p>If the subflow is not an initiating flow (i.e. not annotated with <a href="../../net.corda.v5.application.flows/-initiating-flow/index.html">InitiatingFlow</a>) then it will continue to use
the existing sessions this flow has created with its counterparties. This allows for subflows which can act as
building blocks for other flows, for example removing the boilerplate of common sequences of sends and receives.</p>
<h3>Exceptions</h3>
<p><a name="FlowException"></a>
<code>FlowException</code> - This is either thrown by <a href="sub-flow.html#net.corda.v5.application.flows.flowservices.FlowEngine$subFlow(net.corda.v5.application.flows.Flow((net.corda.v5.application.flows.flowservices.FlowEngine.subFlow.R)))/subLogic">subLogic</a> itself or propagated from any of the remote
<a href="../../net.corda.v5.application.flows/-flow/index.html">Flow</a>s it communicated with. The subflow can be retried by catching this exception.</p>
