the service.
Combined with the corda service lifecycle support, this allows starting a service to depend on another service. It

another service it must be injected before the service start lifecycle event is distributed using this annotation.</p>

<p>Any class that needs to be a long-lived service within the node, should implement this interface. The constructor will be invoked during

Injected services are
injected post instantiation so no injected services can be used within a constructor. Corda services are created as singletons within the

Assuming there are no important wrapped exceptions, throwing a <a href="../net.corda.v5.application.flows/-hospitalize-flow-exception/index.html">HospitalizeFlowException</a>
