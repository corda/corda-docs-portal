<p>A <a href="index.html">FlowSession</a> is a handle on a communication sequence between two paired flows, possibly running on separate nodes.
It is used to send and receive messages between the flows as well as to query information about the counter-flow.</p>
<p>There are two ways of obtaining such a session:</p>
<ol><li>Calling <a href="../-flow-logic/initiate-flow.html">FlowLogic.initiateFlow</a>. This will create a <a href="index.html">FlowSession</a> object on which the first send/receive
operation will attempt to kick off a corresponding <a href="../-initiated-by/index.html">InitiatedBy</a> flow on the counterparty's node.</li>
<li>As constructor parameter to <a href="../-initiated-by/index.html">InitiatedBy</a> flows. This session is the one corresponding to the initiating flow and
may be used for replies.</li>
</ol>
<p>To port flows using the old Party-based API:</p>
<p>Look for <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-deprecated/index.html">Deprecated</a> usages of send/receive/sendAndReceive/getFlowInfo.</p>
<p>If it's an InitiatingFlow:</p>
<p>Look for the send/receive that kicks off the counter flow. Insert a</p>
<pre><code>    val session = initiateFlow(party)</code></pre>
<p>and use this session afterwards for send/receives.
For example:
    send(party, something)
will become
    session.send(something)</p>
<p>If it's an InitiatedBy flow:</p>
<p>Change the constructor to take an otherSideSession: FlowSession instead of a counterparty: Party
Then look for usages of the deprecated functions and change them to use the FlowSession
For example:
    send(counterparty, something)
will become
    otherSideSession.send(something)</p>
