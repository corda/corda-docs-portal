<p>Annotate any class that needs to be a long-lived service within the node, such as an oracle, with this annotation.
Such a class needs to have a constructor with a single parameter of type <a href="#">AppServiceHub</a>. This constructor will be invoked
during node start to initialise the service. The service hub provided can be used to get information about the node
that may be necessary for the service. Corda services are created as singletons within the node and are available
to flows via <a href="../../net.corda.core.node/-service-hub/corda-service.html">ServiceHub.cordaService</a>.</p>
<p>The service class has to implement <a href="../../net.corda.core.serialization/-serialize-as-token/index.html">SerializeAsToken</a> to ensure correct usage within flows. (If possible extend
<a href="../../net.corda.core.serialization/-singleton-serialize-as-token/index.html">SingletonSerializeAsToken</a> instead as it removes the boilerplate.)</p>
