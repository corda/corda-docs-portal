<p>The <a href="../../net.corda.core.identity/-abstract-party/index.html">AbstractParty</a> details of the entity which issued the asset
and a reference blob, which can contain other details related to the token creation e.g. serial number,
warehouse location, etc.
The issuer is the gatekeeper for creating, or destroying the tokens on the digital ledger and
only their <a href="#">PrivateKey</a> signature can authorise transactions that do not conserve the total number
of tokens on the ledger.
Other identities may own the tokens, but they can only create transactions that conserve the total token count.
Typically the issuer is also a well know organisation that can convert digital tokens to external assets
and thus underwrites the digital tokens.
Different issuer values may coexist for a particular product, but these cannot be merged.</p>
