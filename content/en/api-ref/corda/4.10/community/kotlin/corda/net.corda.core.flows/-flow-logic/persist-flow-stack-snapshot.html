<p>Persists a shallow copy of the Quasar stack frames at the time of call to <a href="./persist-flow-stack-snapshot.html">persistFlowStackSnapshot</a>.
Use this to track the monitor evolution of the quasar stack values during the flow execution.
The flow stack snapshot is stored in a file located in {baseDir}/flowStackSnapshots/YYYY-MM-DD/{flowId}/
where baseDir is the node running directory and flowId is the flow unique identifier generated by the platform.</p>
<p>Note: With respect to the <a href="flow-stack-snapshot.html">flowStackSnapshot</a>, the snapshot being persisted by this method is partial,
meaning that only flow relevant traces and local variables are persisted.
Also, this logic is only available during tests and is not meant to be used during the production deployment.
Therefore the default implementation does nothing.</p>
