<p>A progress tracker helps surface information about the progress of an operation to a user interface or API of some
kind. It lets you define a set of <em>steps</em> that represent an operation. A step is represented by an object (typically
a singleton).</p>
<p>Steps may logically be children of other steps, which models the case where a large top level operation involves
sub-operations which may also have a notion of progress. If a step has children, then the tracker will report the
steps children as the "next step" after the parent. In other words, a parent step is considered to involve actual
reportable work and is a thing. If the parent step simply groups other steps, then you'll have to step over it
manually.</p>
<p>Each step has a label. It is assumed by default that the label does not change. If you want a label to change, then
you can emit a <a href="-change/-rendering/index.html">ProgressTracker.Change.Rendering</a> object on the <a href="-step/changes.html">ProgressTracker.Step.changes</a> observable stream
after it changes. That object will propagate through to the top level trackers <a href="changes.html">changes</a> stream, which renderers can
subscribe to in order to learn about progress.</p>
<p>An operation can move both forwards and backwards through steps, thus, a <a href="index.html">ProgressTracker</a> can represent operations
that include loops.</p>
<p>A progress tracker is <em>not</em> thread safe. You may move events from the thread making progress to another thread by
using the <a href="#">Observable</a> subscribeOn call.</p>
