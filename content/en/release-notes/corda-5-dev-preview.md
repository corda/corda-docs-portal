[The Corda 5 Developer Preview](../../en/platform/corda/5.0-dev-preview-1/release-notes-c5dp1.md) is a hands-on advanced look at Cordaâ€™s next major iteration, Corda 5. You can experiment with three key aspects of Corda 5:

* A new modular API structure. This lets you build applications to use on Corda (CorDapps) and test them efficiently.
* An HTTPS API, based on Open API principles. This allows you to control nodes and initiate flows remotely.
* Package your CordApps with a new Gradle plugin that allows for multi-tenancy applications in future releases.
