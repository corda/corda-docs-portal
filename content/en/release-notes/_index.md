# Releases

Release notes for R3 products let you see what's new, what's been enhanced, what's been fixed, and any known issues. Alongside release notes you can also view third-party license information and reference to release files and their artifact checksums.

Find here the release notes for the latest versions of Corda open source, Corda Enterprise, and Corda Enterprise Network Manager (CENM), plus links to historic release notes for reference.

## Corda 5 Developer Preview

[The Corda 5 Developer Preview](/en/platform/corda/5.0-dev-preview-1/release-notes-c5dp1.html) is a hands-on advanced look at Cordaâ€™s next major iteration, Corda 5. You can experiment with three key aspects of Corda 5:

* A new modular API structure. This lets you build applications to use on Corda (CorDapps) and test them efficiently.
* An HTTPS API, based on Open API principles. This allows you to control nodes and initiate flows remotely.
* Package your CordApps with a new Gradle plugin that allows for multi-tenancy applications in future releases.
