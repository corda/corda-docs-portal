# Alerts and releases

This page provides updates on all major alerts, fixes and forthcoming patch releases. Check the top of the page for most urgent alerts. Scroll down for [current release information](#current-releases). 

## Apache Log4j announcement

In response to news of the [Apache Log4j 2 vulnerability to attack](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228), new patches for all supported versions of Corda Open Source, Corda Enterprise, and CENM are in progress.

You do not need to patch CorDapps— they inherit Apache Log4j from the Corda runtime.

Check the [patch release timetable](#corda-and-cenm-patch-release-timetable-for-apache-log4j-issue) for expected patch release dates for your version of Corda or CENM. Use the [mitigation guide](#what-you-can-do-now) to reduce your risk before upgrading to the new patch.

## What you can do now

While you wait for the release of the required emergency patch, you can apply one of the following steps to mitigate the threat implied by the Apache Log4j vulnerability:

### For Corda OS/ENT 4.3 and above and CENM 1.3 and above

Use the `log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups` Java property. Set this property to true when specifying it as a Java parameter when running Corda as follows:

`java -jar corda.jar -Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true`

Alternatively, you can configure a system environment variable which has the same effect. For example, in Linux:

`export LOG4J_FORMAT_MSG_NO_LOOKUPS=true`

In both cases, the Corda node must be restarted for these mitigations to take effect.

### Older versions of Corda

For Corda and CENM versions using an older version of log4j prior to 2.10, the mitigation outlined for later versions does not work. You should continue to check these pages as new mitigation steps are being tested and will be added as soon as possible.
Refer to https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228 or https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html for information in the mean time.

## Corda 5 Developer Preview

[The Corda 5 Developer Preview](../../en/platform/corda/5.0-dev-preview-1/release-notes-c5dp1.md) is a hands-on advanced look at Corda’s next major iteration, Corda 5. You can experiment with three key aspects of Corda 5:

* A new modular API structure. This lets you build applications to use on Corda (CorDapps) and test them efficiently.
* An HTTPS API, based on Open API principles. This allows you to control nodes and initiate flows remotely.
* Package your CordApps with a new Gradle plugin that allows for multi-tenancy applications in future releases.

## Corda open source 4.8

Corda open source 4.8 is the latest open source version of Corda, with commitments to wire and API stability. It introduces several fixes and improvements. States and CorDapps from version 3.0 and above are compatible with Corda 4.8. See the [full 4.8 release notes](../../en/platform/corda/4.8/open-source/release-notes.md).
