## Apache Log4j announcement

### Update December 21 2021

Investigations are in progress following the release of Log4j 2.17.0. As Corda’s explicit disabling of Java
serialization is an effective countermeasure against the vulnerabilities, the update to Log4j 2.17.0 (or the latest version at that time) will be available at the end of January 2022.

Updates for CENM 1.5.3 and the CENM Management Console have been released. Please check the [patch release timetable](#corda-and-cenm-patch-release-timetable-for-apache-log4j-issue) for the updated schedule of outstanding patches.

All fixes move dependencies to Log4j 2.16.0.

### Update December 20 2021

Investigations are in progress following the release of Log4j 2.17.0. As Corda’s explicit disabling of Java
serialization is an effective countermeasure against the vulnerabilities, the update to Log4j 2.17.0 (or the latest version
at that time) will be available at the end of January 2022.

CENM 1.3.4 and Business Network Manager tool 1.1.1 updates have been released. Please check the [patch release timetable](#corda-and-cenm-patch-release-timetable-for-apache-log4j-issue)
for the updated schedule of outstanding patches.

All fixes move dependencies to Log4j 2.16.0.

### Update December 17 2021

All planned Corda OS and Corda Enterprise updates have been released. CENM 1.2.5 has been released. Please check the [patch release timetable](#corda-and-cenm-patch-release-timetable-for-apache-log4j-issue) for the updated schedule of outstanding patches. Some CENM patches have been pushed back from Dec 17 to Dec 20.

All fixes move dependencies to the latest secure patch of Apache Log4j - 2.16.0.

### Update December 16 2021

Patch releases to upgrade Corda and CENM to a safe version of Apache Log4j have been accelerated. Please check the [patch release timetable](#corda-and-cenm-patch-release-timetable-for-apache-log4j-issue) for new dates. Many patches have been brought forward and are now due for release on December 16.

For details of each release, and to get access to downloads, check the release notes page for your version of Corda and CENM in the docs.

### Update December 15 2021

{{< note >}}
A new vulnerability has been discovered in version 2.15.0 of the log4j logging library, as described here: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-45046.
Additional patches are in progress for all current supported software versions for this issue. New patches will upgrade Corda and CENM dependencies to Log4j 2.16.0.
{{< /note >}}


In response to news of the [Apache Log4j 2 vulnerability to attack](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228), and subsequent [vulnerability in the patch Log4j 2.15.0 patch](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-45046), new patches for all supported versions of Corda Open Source, Corda Enterprise, and CENM are in progress.

Check the [patch release timetable](#corda-and-cenm-patch-release-timetable-for-apache-log4j-issue) for expected patch release dates for your version of Corda or CENM. Use the [mitigation guide](#what-you-can-do-now) to reduce your risk before upgrading to the new patch.

## What you can do now

If a patch has been released for your current version of Corda, follow the instructions for [upgrading nodes to a new minor version](../en/platform/corda/4.8/enterprise/minor-version-node-upgrade.md). You do not need to patch CorDapps— they inherit Apache Log4j from the Corda runtime.

If you are waiting for the release of the required emergency patch for your current version, you can apply one of the following steps to mitigate the threat implied by the Apache Log4j vulnerability:

### For Corda OS/ENT 4.3 and above and CENM 1.3 and above

Use the `log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups` Java property. Set this property to true when specifying it as a Java parameter when running Corda as follows:

`java -Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true -jar corda.jar`

Alternatively, you can configure a system environment variable which has the same effect. For example, in Linux:

`export LOG4J_FORMAT_MSG_NO_LOOKUPS=true`

In both cases, the Corda node must be restarted for these mitigations to take effect.

### Older versions of Corda

For Corda and CENM versions using an older version of log4j prior to 2.10, the mitigation outlined for later versions does not work. You should continue to check these pages as new mitigation steps are being tested and will be added as soon as possible.
Refer to https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228 or https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html for information in the mean time.
