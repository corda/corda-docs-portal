Once a [push transfer request]({{< relref "creating-push-transfer-requests.md" >}}) or [pull transfer request]({{< relref "creating-pull-transfer-requests.md" >}}) has been initiated, it must then either be approved or rejected. In the case of a push transfer, it must be approved by the recipient; in the case of a pull transfer, it must be approved by the sender. 

To approve or reject a transfer:

1. In the left-hand menu, click on **Transfers**.

   The **Transfers** page is displayed, showing the following panels related to transfers:

   * **Vault Balances**: A Corda vault is a database containing all data from the ledger relevant to a participant. For more information, see [the Vault topic]({{< relref "/en/platform/corda/5.0/developing-applications/ledger/vault/_index.md" >}}).
   * **Request**: Allows you to create a push or pull transfer request; for more on creating pull requests, see [Creating Pull Transfer Requests]({{< relref "creating-pull-transfer-requests.md" >}}).
   * **Transfer:** Allows you to perform a push transfer which does not require approval from the recipient; see [Performing Push Transfers]({{< relref "performing-push-transfers.md" >}}).
   * **Transfer Requests:** Lists any existing transfer requests and their status.

   >}}
   
   For each transfer request, the following information is displayed:
   
   * **Status:** The status of the request.
   * **Token name:** The name of the token definition; normally the full name of the currency; for example, UAE Dirham.
   * **Token symbol:** A symbol for the token definition; normally the [three-letter ISO-4217 code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217) for the currency; for example, *AED*.
   * **Amount:** The number of tokens requested.
   * **Approver:** The participant that either (1) has to approve the receipt of tokens (if the other party made a push request) or (2) has to approve the sending of tokens (if the other party made a pull request).
   * **Requester:** The participant that created the transfer request.
   * **Last Updated:** The date and time at which the request was last updated.
   
2. Click on the relevant transfer request.

   The **Transfer Request** dialog box is displayed:

   >}}

3. Click **Approve**. 

   (Alternately, you can click **Reject** if you do not want the transfer to proceed.)
   
   The message **Your token transfer approval update has been successfully submitted** is displayed:

   {{<

      width=40%
	  alt="'Your token transfer approval update has been successfully submitted' Message"
	  figcaption="'Your token transfer approval update has been successfully submitted' Message"
   >}}

   The **Update Transfer Request** flow begins and its progress can be checked in the pull-out flow tracker on the right-hand side of the screen:
    
   {{<

      width=50%
	  figcaption="Update Transfer Request - Flow Running"
	  alt="Update Transfer Request - Flow Running"
   >}}  

   Once the **Update Transfer** Request flow finishes, the message *Your request update has been successful* is displayed:

   {{< 
      figure
	  src="images/your-request-update-has-been-successful-message.png"
      width=50%
	  alt="'Your request update has been successful' Message"
	  figcaption="'Your request update has been successful' Message"
   >}}
   
   The **Transfer Requests** pane is updated to display the transfer request with a status of Approved:
