# Welcome to Digital Currencies

Welcome to the documentation for the Digital Currencies for Corda 5 GUI. The purpose of this documentation is to describe the concepts behind Digital Currencies, show the lifecycle of a digital token definition, describe the functionality available to participants in a digital currency network, and how these actions can be performed via the Digital Currencies GUI.

R3 Digital Currencies for Corda 5 enables central banks, commercial banks and institutions to define their own digital currency token types and perform the following actions based on those definitions:

* mint tokens
* request an issuance of tokens from the issuer
* transfer tokens to each other
* redeem tokens
* burn tokens
