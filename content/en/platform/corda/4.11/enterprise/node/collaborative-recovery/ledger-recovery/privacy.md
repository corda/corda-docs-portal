# Privacy

The ledger recovery `DistributionList` is encrypted using AES keys stored in the node's database.
Upon startup, a node creates ten random AES keys and stores them in the `node_aes_encryption_keys` table, if there are no keys already present.
The keys themselves are obfuscated, by wrapping them with a deterministic AES key derived from the key's ID and the node's X.500 name.

This obfuscation only reduces the impact of an accidental data dump of the keys, and is not meant to be secure.

`senderRecordedTimestamp` is in a separate header object, and is treated as the authenticated additional
data in the AES-GCM encryption. This allows it to be public, which is necessary to allow the receiver node to read it
without having access to the encryption key. It also gives a guarantee to the original sender during recovery that it has not been tampered with.
