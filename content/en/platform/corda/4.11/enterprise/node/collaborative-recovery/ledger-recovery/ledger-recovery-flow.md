# Ledger Recovery flow parameters

The Ledger Recovery flow takes the following parameters:

```
val recoveryPeers: Collection<Party>,
val timeWindow: RecoveryTimeWindow? = null,
val useAllNetworkNodes: Boolean = false,
val dryRun: Boolean = false,
val useTimeWindowNarrowing: Boolean = true,
val verboseLogging: Boolean = false,
val recoveryBatchSize: Int = 1000,
val alsoFinalize: Boolean = false
```

#### `recoveryPeers`

`recoveryPeers` refers to a list of peer nodes to use for recovery.  This parameter is mandatory unless using `useAllNetworkNodes`.

#### `timeWindows`

`timeWindow` refers to the recovery time window and defines a `fromTime` and `untilTime`. This parameter is mandatory,
if not explicitly defined in configuration.

If a value is not specified by the user, the flow will attempt to use the Corda Network or Node Configuration configured time window.
The precedence order for this parameter is user-specified first, then Node Configuration, then Corda Network parameter.

#### `useAllNetworkNodes`

`useAllNetworkNodes` specifies if all peer nodes in the network map (excluding notary nodes) are to be used for recovery.
This parameter is optional. The default value is *false*. If set to *true*, this parameter overrides the `recoveryPeers` list.

#### `dryRun`

`dryRun` can be used to identify missing transactions without performing actual recovery. This parameter is optional. It defaults to *false*.

#### `useTimeWindowNarrowing`

`useTimeWindowNarrowing` specifies whether to use a window narrowing algorithm to determine the optimal time window of transactions
that are recoverable from a peer. It defaults to *true*.
For example, if the original time window specifies 30 days and there are only 3 consecutive days of missing transactions
from day 10 to day 12, a narrowed time window will determine that reconciliation only needs to take place for that 3-day time period.

#### `verboseLogging`

`verboseLogging` specifies whether to log details of each recovered transaction. By default, the flow will only report
total counts of recovered records. It defaults to *false*.

#### `recoveryBatchSize`

`recoveryBatchSize` is a performance-tuning parameter that specifies how many records should be recovered in each interaction with
a recovery peer. It has been fine-tuned to a value of 1000, and can be tweaked to take into account the amount of physical memory
available on a node host.

#### `alsoFinalize`

`alsoFinalize` specifies whether to attempt recovery of any `IN_FLIGHT` transactions recovered from a peer.
It defaults to *false*. See also [Finality Flow Recovery](finality-flow-recovery.md).
{{< note >}}
This option will attempt to finalize any `FAILED` in-flight transactions (either recovered as part of the previous
ledger recovery step or already existent within the local database) within the recovery `timeWindow`.

#### `LedgerRecoverFlow`

`LedgerRecoverFlow` returns a `LedgerRecoveryResult` which includes the following information:

* `totalRecoveredRecords`: Long; total number of recovered transaction Distribution Records. For the purpose of recovery counting,
  there is a one-to-one association with a single transaction on a node.
* `totalRecoveredTransactions`: Long; total number of recovered transactions. This may be less than the total number of Distribution Records
  if there are any transactions that already exist in the recovering node's database.
* `totalRecoveredInFlightTransactions`: Long; total number of in-flight transactions recovered where the `alsoFinalize` option has been specified.
* `totalErrors`: Long; total number of errors encountered upon attempting recovery. See the node logs for details of these errors.

A `LedgerRecoveryException` is thrown if a fatal error occurs upon attempting recovery; for example, if no time window is
specified and no time window configuration is defined.

{{< warning >}}
This flow only works with transactions that are persisted with recovery metadata, as of Corda 4.11, version 13.
