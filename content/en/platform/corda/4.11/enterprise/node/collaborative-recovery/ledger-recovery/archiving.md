# Archiving

The [Archive Service](../../../tools/archiving-service/archiving-service-index.md) archives Ledger Recovery distribution
records associated with the archived transactions. (The tables `node_sender_distribution_records` and `node_receiver_distribution_records`
are included in the archiving process.)
