# Performance

The Ledger Recovery flow has been optimised to support large-scale recovery of transactions (internal testing has been conducted
using tens of thousands of transactions). This has been accomplished using a combination of parallelism (when recovering against
more than one peer) and batching at several layers (reconciliation window, across-the-wire transfer of records and transactions,
and database transactional updates). Window narrowing uses a cryptographic hashing algorithm to rapidly determine the optimal recovery
window for any given peer. Furthermore, internal state is kept to a minimum, thus enabling recovery to be resumed from the
point it left off, should there be any interruption in service.
