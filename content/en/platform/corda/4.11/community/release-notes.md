## Platform version change

Corda 4.11 uses platform version 13.

## New features and enhancements



## Fixed issues

This release includes the following fixes:

* When a notary worker is shut down, message ID cleanup is now performed as the last shutdown activity, rather than the first; this prevents a situation where the notary worker might still appear to be part of the notary cluster and receiving client traffic while shutting down.

* Debug logging of the Artemis server has been added.
