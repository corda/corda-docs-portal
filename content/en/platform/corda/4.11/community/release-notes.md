# Corda Community Edition 4.11 release notes

Corda Community Edition 4.11 includes several new features, enhancements, and fixes.

## Platform version change

Corda 4.11 uses platform version 13.

For more information about platform versions, see [Versioning]({{< relref "versioning.md" >}}).

## New features and enhancements

* The following dependencies have been upgraded to address critical- and high-severity security vulnerabilities:
  * H2 has been upgraded from 1.4.197 to 2.1.214.
  * Hibernate has been upgraded from 5.4.32.Final to 5.6.14.Final.
  * Liquibase has been upgraded from 3.6.3 to 4.20.0.

* When a state is consumed by a transaction, the ID of the consuming transaction is now added to the `vault_state` table in the `consuming_tx_id` column. Note that this database column will only be updated for new transactions; for existing consumed states already in the ledger, the value of this consuming_tx_id will be null.

## Fixed issues

This release includes the following fixes:

* When a notary worker is shut down, message ID cleanup is now performed as the last shutdown activity, rather than the first; this prevents a situation where the notary worker might still appear to be part of the notary cluster and receiving client traffic while shutting down.

* Debug logging of the Artemis server has been added.

* A new property, `previousPageAnchor`, has been added to `Vault.Page`. It is used to detect if the vault has changed while pages of a vault query have been loaded. If such a scenario is important to detect, then the property can be used to restart querying.

  A example of how to use this property can be found in [Vault Queries]({{< relref "api-vault-query.md#query-for-all-states-using-a-pagination-specification-and-iterate-using-the-totalstatesavailable-field-until-no-further-pages-available-1" >}}).
