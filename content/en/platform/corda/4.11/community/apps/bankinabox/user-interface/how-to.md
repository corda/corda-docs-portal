# How-to guide

When using the Bank in a Box application, you will be able to perform different tasks depending on your user role.

There are three user roles available in the application: Admin, Customer, and Guest.

As an Admin user, you can perform administrative tasks, managing user profiles and accounts:

* Create customer profiles.
* Create accounts.
* Change an account status.
* Assign and revoke user roles.
* Issue a loan.
* Approve an overdraft.
* Deposit money to an account.
* Register as a user on Bank in the Box.
* Update a Customer profile.
* Set withdrawal and transfer limits.

As a Customer user, you can perform all tasks related to your daily banking needs:

* Create an intrabank payment.
* Create a recurring payment.
* Register as a user on Bank in the Box.
* Update your profile.
* Set withdrawal and transfer limits.

As a Guest user, you can register as a user on Bank in a Box. However, you will not be able to perform any other tasks unless an Admin user assigns you the role of Customer.
