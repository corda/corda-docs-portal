# Platform support matrix

Corda supports a subset of the platforms that are supported by [Java](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/certconfig-2095354.html).

Production use of Corda Community Edition 4.11 is only supported on Linux OS, see details below.

## Network management

The Community Edition of Corda does not come with network management support included. You can still consider joining the [Corda Network](https://corda.network).

If you require network management, you can consider using the [Network Map Service from Cordite](https://gitlab.com/cordite/network-map-service). Cordite Foundation is a third-party supplier, and not supported by R3.

## Notaries

Experimental notaries, such as **Crash fault-tolerant** and **Byzantine fault-tolerant** notaries, are not available for support in Corda: Community Edition.

## JDK support

Corda: Community Edition 4.11 has been tested and verified to work with **Oracle JDK 8 JVM 8u351** and **Azul Zulu Enterprise 8u352**, for Azure deployment downloadable from
[Azul Systems](https://www.azul.com/downloads/azure-only/zulu/).

Other distributions of the [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net/) are not officially supported but should be compatible with Corda Enterprise Edition 4.11.

{{< warning >}}
In accordance with the [Oracle Java SE Support Roadmap](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/java-se-support-roadmap.html),
which outlines the end of public updates of Java SE 8 for commercial use, please ensure you have the correct Java support contract in place
for your deployment needs.

## JDKs supported in development

Install the **Java 8 JDK**. Corda does not currently support Java 9 or higher.
