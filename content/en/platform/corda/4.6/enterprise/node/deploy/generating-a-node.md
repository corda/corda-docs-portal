# Creating nodes locally

Local nodes are used for testing and demo purposes only.

There are two ways you can create a node locally:
* __Manually__: create a local directory, add the relevant node and CorDapp files, and configure them.
* __Automatically__: use the __Cordform__ or __Dockerform__ gradle plug-ins, which automatically generate and configure a local set of nodes.

## Create a local node manually

To create a local node manually, make a new directory and add the following files and sub-directories:

* The Corda `.jar` artifact file, downloaded from [https://r3.bintray.com/corda/net/corda/corda/](https://r3.bintray.com/corda/net/corda/corda/) - under `../4.6/corda-4.6.jar`.
* A node configuration file with a name `node.conf`, configured as described in the [Node configuration](../setup/corda-configuration-file.md) section.
* A sub-directory with a name `cordapps`, containing any CorDapp `.jar` files you want the node to load.
* An up-to-date version of the `network-parameters` file (see [The network map](../../network/network-map.md#network-parameters)), generated by the bootstrapper tool.

The remaining node files and directories will be generated at runtime. These are described in the [Node folder structure](../setup/corda-configuration-file.md) section.

### Run the database migration script if upgrading

{{< note >}} This step is only required when upgrading to Corda Enterpise 4.6. {{< /note >}}

1. Remove any `transactionIsolationLevel`, `initialiseSchema`, or `initialiseAppSchema` entries from the database section of your configuration.
2. Start the node with `run-migration-scripts` sub-command with `--core-schemas` and `--app-schemas`:

```bash
java -jar corda.jar run-migration-scripts --core-schemas --app-schemas
```

The node will perform any automatic data migrations required, which may take some time. If the migration process is interrupted, it can be continued simply by starting the node again, without harm. The node will stop automatically when migration is complete.

See [Upgrading your node to Corda 4.6](../../node-upgrade-notes.md) for more information.

## Step 7. Start the node in the normal way

Start the node in the normal way.



## Use Cordform and Dockerform to create a set of local nodes automatically

Corda provides two `gradle` plug-ins called `Cordform` and `Dockerform`. They both allow you to run tasks that automatically generate and configure a local set of nodes for testing and demonstration purposes.

* A `Cordform` task creates nodes in the `build/nodes` directory. The example `Cordform` task used in this document creates three nodes: `Notary`, `PartyA`, and `PartyB`, however you are free to spin up more nodes, specify what nodes you need on the network, change node names, and update node configurations.
* Nodes deployed via `Dockerform` use Docker containers. A `Dockerform` task is similar to `Cordform` but it provides an extra file that enables you to easily spin up nodes using `docker-compose`. This creates a `docker-compose` file that enables you to run a single command to control the deployment of Corda nodes and databases (instead of deploying each node/database manually).

### Specific requirements

* `Cordform` tasks require you to deploy each Corda node and database separately.
* `Dockerform` tasks require Docker to be installed on the local host.


### Tasks using the Cordform plug-in

Run this example task to create the following three nodes in the `build/nodes` directory:

A `Notary` node, which:
* Provides a validating Notary service.
* Runs the `corda-finance` CorDapp.

`PartyA` and `PartyB` nodes, each of which:
* Does not provide any services.
* Runs the `corda-finance` CorDapp.
* Has an RPC (Remote Procedure Call) user (`user1`), which enables you to log in the node via RPC.

All three nodes also include any CorDapps defined in the project's source directories, even if these CorDapps are not listed in each node's `cordapps` setting. As a result, if you run the `deployNodes` task from the template CorDapp, for example, it will automatically build and add the template CorDapp to each node.

{{< note >}}
The three nodes described here are just an example. `Cordform` allows you specify any number of nodes and you can define their configurations and names as needed.
{{< /note >}}

The following example, as defined in the [Kotlin CorDapp Template](https://github.com/corda/cordapp-template-kotlin/blob/release-V4/build.gradle#L120), shows a `Cordform` task called `deployNodes` that creates the three nodes described above: `Notary`, `PartyA`, and `PartyB`.

```groovy
task deployNodes(type: net.corda.plugins.Cordform, dependsOn: ['jar']) {
    directory "./build/nodes"
    node {
        name "O=Notary,L=London,C=GB"
        // The Notary will offer a validating Notary service.
        notary = [validating : true]
        p2pPort  10002
        rpcSettings {
            port 10003
            adminPort 10023
        }
        h2Port   10004
        // Starts an internal SSH server providing a management shell on the node.
        sshdPort 2223
        // Includes the corda-finance CorDapp on our node.
        cordapps = ["$corda_release_distribution:corda-finance:$corda_release_version"]
        extraConfig = [
            // Setting the JMX reporter type.
            jmxReporterType: 'JOLOKIA',
            // Setting the H2 address.
            h2Settings: [ address: 'localhost:10030' ]
        ]
    }
    node {
        name "O=PartyA,L=London,C=GB"
        p2pPort  10005
        rpcSettings {
            port 10006
            adminPort 10026
        }
        h2Port   10008
        cordapps = ["$corda_release_distribution:corda-finance:$corda_release_version"]
        // Grants user1 all RPC permissions.
        rpcUsers = [[ user: "user1", "password": "test", "permissions": ["ALL"]]]
    }
    node {
        name "O=PartyB,L=New York,C=US"
        p2pPort  10009
        rpcSettings {
            port 10010
            adminPort 10030
        }
        h2Port   10012
        cordapps = ["$corda_release_distribution:corda-finance:$corda_release_version"]
        // Grants user1 the ability to start the MyFlow flow.
        rpcUsers = [[ user: "user1", "password": "test", "permissions": ["StartFlow.net.corda.flows.MyFlow"]]]
    }
}
```

{{< note >}}
Make sure to use Corda gradle plugin version 5.0.10 or above.
{{< /note >}}

The configuration values used in the example are described below.

#### Required configuration

* `name` &lt;string&gt; - use this configuration option to specify the legal identity name of the Corda node. For more information, see [myLegalName](../setup/corda-configuration-fields.md#mylegalname). For example:

```kotlin
name "O=PartyA,L=London,C=GB"
```
* `p2pAddress` &lt;string&gt; - use this configuration option to specify the address/port the node uses for inbound communication from other nodes. For more information, see [p2pAddress](../setup/corda-configuration-fields.md#p2paddress). **Required if `p2pPort` is not specified**. For example:

```kotlin
p2pAddress "example.com:10002"
```
* `p2pPort` &lt;integer&gt; - use this configuration option to specify the port the node uses for inbound communication from other nodes. The assumed IP address is `localhost`. For more information, see [p2pAddress](../setup/corda-configuration-fields.md#p2paddress). For example:

```kotlin
p2pPort 10006  // "localhost:10006"
```

* `rpcSettings` &lt;config&gt; - use this configuration option to specify RPC settings for the node. For more information, see [rpcSettings](../setup/corda-configuration-fields.md#rpcsettings). For example:

```kotlin
rpcSettings {
  port 10006
  adminPort 10026
}
```

#### Optional configuration

* `notary` &lt;config&gt; - use this configuration option to specify the node as a Notary node. **Required**> for Notary nodes. For more information, see [Notary](../setup/corda-configuration-fields.md#notary).

* `devMode` &lt;boolean&gt; - use this configuration option to enable development mode when you set its value to `true`. For more information, see [devMode](../setup/corda-configuration-fields.md#devmode). For example:

```kotlin
devMode true
```

* `rpcUsers` &lt;list&gt; - use this configuration option to set the RPC users for the node. For more information, see [rpcUsers](../setup/corda-configuration-fields.md#rpcusers). You can use arbitrary values in this configuration block - "incorrect" settings will not cause a DSL error. An example follows below:

```kotlin
rpcUsers = [[ user: "user1", "password": "test", "permissions": ["StartFlow.net.corda.flows.MyFlow"]]]
```

* `configFile` &lt;string&gt; - use this configuration option to generate an extended node configuration. For more information, see [extended node configuration](#generating-a-node-extended-config). For example:

```kotlin
configFile = "samples/trader-demo/src/main/resources/node-b.conf"
```

* `sshdPort` &lt;integer&gt; - use this configuration option to specify the SSH port for the Docker container. This will be mapped to the same port on the host.  If `sshdPort` is specified, then that port must be available on the host and not in use by some other service. If `sshdPort` is not specified, then a default value will be used for the SSH port on the container. Use the `docker port <container_name>` command to check which port has been allocated on the host for your container. For more information, see [sshd](../setup/corda-configuration-fields.md#sshd). For example:

```kotlin
sshd {
  port = 2222
}
```

You can extend the `deployNodes` task with more `node {}` blocks to generate as many nodes as necessary for your application.

{{< warning >}}
When adding nodes, make sure that there are no port clashes!
{{< /warning >}}

To extend node configuration beyond the properties defined in the `deployNodes` task, use the `configFile` property with the file path (relative or absolute) set to an additional configuration file. This file should follow the standard [Node configuration](../setup/corda-configuration-file.md) format of `node.conf`. The properties set there will be appended to the generated node configuration.

{{< note >}}
If you add a property to the additional configuration file that has already been created by the `deployNodes` task, both properties will be present in generated node configuration.
{{< /note >}}

Alternatively, you can also add the path to the additional configuration file while running the gradle task via the `-PconfigFile` command-line option. However, this will result in the same configuration file being applied to all nodes.

Following on from the previous example, the `PartyB` node in the next example below has additional configuration options added from a file called `none-b.conf`:

```groovy
task deployNodes(type: net.corda.plugins.Cordform, dependsOn: ['jar']) {
    [...]
    node {
        name "O=PartyB,L=New York,C=US"
        [...]
        // Grants user1 the ability to start the MyFlow flow.
        rpcUsers = [[ user: "user1", "password": "test", "permissions": ["StartFlow.net.corda.flows.MyFlow"]]]
        configFile = "samples/trader-demo/src/main/resources/node-b.conf"
    }
}
```

The `drivers` Cordform parameter in the `node` entry lists paths of the files to be copied to the `drivers` sub-directory of the node.
To copy the same file to all nodes, define `ext.drivers` in the top level, and reuse it for each node by setting `drivers=ext.drivers`.

```groovy
task deployNodes(type: net.corda.plugins.Cordform, dependsOn: ['jar']) {
    ext.drivers = ['lib/my_common_jar.jar']
    [...]
    node {
        name "O=PartyB,L=New York,C=US"
        [...]
        drivers = ext.drivers + ['lib/my_specific_jar.jar']
    }
}
```

#### Package namespace ownership

To configure [package namespace ownership](env-dev.md#package-namespace-ownership), use the optional `networkParameterOverrides` and `packageOwnership` blocks, in a similar way to how the configuration file is used by the [Network Bootstrapper](../../network-bootstrapper.md/) tool. For example:

```groovy
task deployNodes(type: net.corda.plugins.Cordform, dependsOn: ['jar']) {
    [...]
    networkParameterOverrides {
        packageOwnership {
            "com.mypackagename" {
                keystore = "_teststore"
                keystorePassword = "MyStorePassword"
                keystoreAlias = "MyKeyAlias"
            }
        }
    }
    [...]
}
```

#### Sign CorDapp `.jar` files

The default Cordform behaviour is to deploy CorDapp `.jar` files “as built”.

* Prior to Corda 4.0, all CorDapp `.jar` files were unsigned.
* As of Corda 4.0, CorDapp `.jar` files created by the gradle `cordapp` plug-in are signed by a Corda development certificate by default.

You can use the Cordform `signing` entry to override and customise the signing of CorDapp `.jar` files.
Signing a CorDapp enables its contract classes to use signature constraints instead of other types of constraints, such as [Contract Constraints](../../cordapps/api-contract-constraints.md).

The signing task may use an external keystore, or create a new one.
You can use the following parameters in the `signing` entry:


* `enabled` - the control flag to enable the signing process. It is set to `false` by default. Set to `true` to enable signing.
* `all` - if set to `true` (default), all CorDapps inside the `cordapp` sub-directory will be signed. If set to `false`, only the generated Cordapp will be signed.
* `options` - any relevant parameters of [SignJar ANT task](https://ant.apache.org/manual/Tasks/signjar.html) and [GenKey ANT task](https://ant.apache.org/manual/Tasks/genkey.html). By default the `.jar` file is signed by a Corda development key. You can specify the external keystore can be specified. The minimal list of required options is shown below. For other options, see [SignJar task](https://ant.apache.org/manual/Tasks/signjar.html).
    * `keystore` - the path to the keystore file. The default setting is `cordadevcakeys.jks`. The keystore is shipped with the plug-in.
    * `alias` - the alias to sign under. The default value is `cordaintermediateca`.
    * `storepass` - the keystore password. The default value is `cordacadevpass`.
    * `keypass` - the private key password, if it is different from the keystore password. The default value is `cordacadevkeypass`.
    * `storetype` - the keystore type. The default value is `JKS`.
    * `dname` - the distinguished name for the entity. Only use this option when `generateKeystore` is set to `true` (see below).
    * `keyalg` - the method to use when generating a name-value pair. The default value is `RSA` because Corda does not support `DSA`. Only use this option when `generateKeystore` is set to `true` (see below).
* `generateKeystore` - the flag to generate a keystore. The default value is `false`. If set to `true`, an "ad hoc" keystore is created and its key is used instead of the default Corda development key or any external key. The same `options` to specify an external keystore are used to define the newly created keystore. In addition,
`dname` and `keyalg` are required. Other options are described in [GenKey task](https://ant.apache.org/manual/Tasks/genkey.html). If the existing keystore is already present, the task will reuse it. However if the file is inside the `build` directory,
then it will be deleted when the gradle `clean` task is run.

The example below shows the minimal set of `options` required to create a dummy keystore:

```groovy
task deployNodes(type: net.corda.plugins.Cordform, dependsOn: ['jar']) {
     signing {
        enabled true
        generateKeystore true
        all false
        options {
            keystore "./build/nodes/jarSignKeystore.p12"
            alias "cordapp-signer"
            storepass "secret1!"
            storetype "PKCS12"
            dname "OU=Dummy Cordapp Distributor, O=Corda, L=London, C=GB"
            keyalg "RSA"
        }
    }
    //...
```

Contracts classes from signed CorDapp `.jar` files are checked by signature constraints by default.
You can force them to be checked by zone constraints by adding contract class names to the `includeWhitelist` entry - the list will generate an `include_whitelist.txt` file used internally by the [Network Bootstrapper](../../network-bootstrapper.md/) tool.
Before you add `includeWhitelist` to the `deployNodes` task, see [Contract Constraints](../../cordapps/api-contract-constraints.md) to understand the implications of using different constraint types.
The snippet below configures contracts classes from the Finance CorDapp to be verified using zone constraints instead of signature constraints:

```groovy
task deployNodes(type: net.corda.plugins.Cordform, dependsOn: ['jar']) {
    includeWhitelist = [ "net.corda.finance.contracts.asset.Cash", "net.corda.finance.contracts.asset.CommercialPaper" ]
    //...
```
#### Optional migration step

If you are migrating your database schema from an older Corda version to Corda 4.6, you must add the following parameter to the node section in the `build.gradle` and set it to `true`, as follows:

```
        runSchemaMigration = true
```

This step runs the full schema migration process as the last step of the Cordform task, and leave the nodes ready to run.

#### Run the Cordform task

To create the nodes defined in the `deployNodes` task example above, run the following command in a command prompt or a terminal window, from the root of the project where the `deployNodes` task is defined:

* Linux/macOS: `./gradlew deployNodes`
* Windows: `gradlew.bat deployNodes`

This command creates the nodes in the `build/nodes` directory. A node directory is generated for each node defined in the `deployNodes` task, plus a `runnodes` shell script (or a batch file on Windows) to run all the nodes at once for testing and development purposes. If you make any changes to your CorDapp source or `deployNodes` task, you will need to re-run the task to see the changes take effect.

### Tasks using the Dockerform plug-in

You need both `Docker` and `docker-compose` installed and enabled to use this method. Docker CE
(Community Edition) is sufficient. Please refer to [Docker CE documentation](https://www.docker.com/community-edition)
and [Docker Compose documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) for installation instructions for all
major operating systems.

Dockerform supports the following configuration options for each node:

* `name`
* `notary`
* `cordapps`
* `rpcUsers`
* `useTestClock`

You do not need to specify the node ports because every node has a separate container so no ports conflicts will occur. Every node will expose port `10003` for RPC connections. Docker will then map these to available ports on your host machine.

You should interact with each node via its shell over SSH - see the [node configuration options](../setup/corda-configuration-file.md) for more information.

To enable the shell, you need to set the `sshdPort` number for each node in the gradle task - this is explained in the section [run the Dockerform task](#run-the-dockerform-task) further below. For example:

```groovy
node {
    name "O=PartyA,L=London,C=GB"
    p2pPort 10002
    rpcSettings {
        address("localhost:10003")
        adminAddress("localhost:10023")
    }
    rpcUsers = [[user: "user1", "password": "test", "permissions": ["ALL"]]]
    sshdPort 2223
}
```

{{< note >}}
Make sure to use Corda gradle plugin version 5.0.10 or above. If you do not specify the `sshd` port number for a node, it will use the default value `2222`. Please run the `docker ps` command to check the allocated port on your host that maps to this port.
{{< /note >}}

The Docker image associated with each node can be configured in the `Dockerform` task. This will initialise *every* node in the `Dockerform` task with the specified Docker image. If you need nodes with different Docker images, you can edit the `docker-compose.yml` file with your preferred image.

{{< note >}}
Before running any Corda Enterprise Docker images, you must accept the license agreement and indicate that you have done this by setting the environment variable `ACCEPT_LICENSE` to `YES` or `Y` on your machine. If you do not do this, none of the Docker containers will start.

As an alternative, you can specify this parameter when running the `docker-compose up` command, for example:
`ACCEPT_LICENSE=Y docker-compose up`
{{< /note >}}

#### Specify an external database

You can configure `Dockerform` to use a standalone database to test with non-H2 databases. For example, to use PostgresSQL, you need to make the following changes to your Cordapp project:

1. Create a file called `postgres.gradle` in your Cordapp directory, and insert the following code block:

```groovy
ext {
    postgresql_version     = '42.2.12'
    postgres_image_version = '11'
    dbUser                 = 'myuser'
    dbPassword             = 'mypassword'
    dbSchema               = 'myschema'
    dbName                 = 'mydb'
    dbPort                 = 5432
    dbHostName             = 'localhost'
    dbDockerfile           = 'Postgres_Dockerfile'
    dbInit                 = 'Postgres_init.sh'
    dbDataVolume           =  [
            hostPath      : 'data',
            containerPath : '/var/lib/postgresql/data:\${SUFFIX}',
            containerPathArgs   : [
                    SUFFIX : "rw"
            ]
    ]
    postgres = [
            dataSourceProperties: [
                    dataSourceClassName: 'org.postgresql.ds.PGSimpleDataSource',
                    dataSource: [
                            user    : dbUser,
                            password: dbPassword,
                            url     : "jdbc:postgresql://\${DBHOSTNAME}:\${DBPORT}/\${DBNAME}?currentSchema=\${DBSCHEMA}",
                            urlArgs : [
                                    DBHOSTNAME  : dbHostName,

                            ]
                    ]
            ],
            database: [
                    schema                   : dbSchema
            ],
            dockerConfig: [
                    dbDockerfile    : dbDockerfile,
                    dbDockerfileArgs: [

                         DBUSER         : dbUser,
                         DBPASSWORD     : dbPassword,
                         DBPORT         : dbPort
                    ],
                    dbUser          : dbUser,
                    dbPassword      : dbPassword,

2. In the `build.gradle` file, add the gradle task `generateInitScripts` to the `dependsOn` list of the `prepareDockerNodes` task, add the `dockerConfig` element, and initialise it with the `postgres` block. An example is shown below:

```groovy
task prepareDockerNodes(type: net.corda.plugins.Dockerform, dependsOn: ['jar',  'generateInitScripts']) {

    [...]

    node {
        [...]
    }

    // The postgres block from the postgres.gradle file
    dockerConfig = postgres
}
```

The `postgres.gradle` file includes the following:
* A gradle task called `generateInitScripts` used to generate the Postgres Docker image files.
* A set of variables used to initialise the Postgres Docker image.

To set up the external database, you must place the following two files in the `build` directory:
* `Postgres_Dockerfile` -  a wrapper for the base Postgres Docker image.
* `Postgres_init.sh` -  a shell script to initialise the database.

The `Postgres_Dockerfile` is referenced in the `docker-compose.yml` file and allows for a number of arguments for configuring the Docker image.

You can use the following configuration parameters in the `postgres.gradle` file:

| Parameter              | Description                                       |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| postgresql_version     | Version of JDBC driver to connect to the database |
| postgres_image_version | Version of Postgres Docker image                  |
| dbUser                 | Database user                                     |
| dbPassword             | Database password                                 |
| dbSchema               | Postgres schema                                   |
| dbName                 | Database name                                     |
| dbPort                 | Database port (default: 5432)                     |
| dbHostName             | Database host (default: localhost)                |
| dbInit                 | Initialisation script for Postgres Docker image   |
| dbDockerfile           | Wrapper of base Postgres Docker image             |
| dbDataVolume           | Path to database files for Postgres Docker image  |

To make the database files persistent across multiple `docker-compose` runs, you must set the `dbDataVolume` parameter. If this variable is commented out, the database files will be removed after every `docker-compose` run.

#### Run the Dockerform task

To run the Dockerform task, follow the steps below.

{{< note >}}
The node configuration described here is just an example. `Dockerform` allows you specify any number of nodes and you can define their configurations and names as needed.
{{< /note >}}

1. Open the `build.gradle` file of your Cordapp project and add a new gradle task, as shown in the example below.

{{< note >}}
Make sure to use Corda gradle plugin version 5.0.10 or above.
{{< /note >}}

{{% warning %}}
The docker image name must be specified by using the `dockerImage` property.
{{% /warning %}}

```groovy
task prepareDockerNodes(type: net.corda.plugins.Dockerform, dependsOn: ['jar']) {
    // set docker image for each node
    dockerImage = "corda/corda-zulu-java1.8-4.4"

    nodeDefaults {
        cordapp project(":contracts-java")
    }
    node {
        name "O=Notary,L=London,C=GB"
        notary = [validating : false]
        p2pPort 10002
        rpcSettings {
            address("localhost:10003")
            adminAddress("localhost:10023")
        }
        projectCordapp {
            deploy = false
        }
        cordapps.clear()
        sshdPort 2222
    }
    node {
        name "O=PartyA,L=London,C=GB"
        p2pPort 10002
        rpcSettings {
            address("localhost:10003")
            adminAddress("localhost:10023")
        }
        rpcUsers = [[user: "user1", "password": "test", "permissions": ["ALL"]]]
        sshdPort 2223
    }
    node {
        name "O=PartyB,L=New York,C=US"
        p2pPort 10002
        rpcSettings {
            address("localhost:10003")
            adminAddress("localhost:10023")
        }
        rpcUsers = [[user: "user1", "password": "test", "permissions": ["ALL"]]]
        sshdPort 2224
    }

    // This property needs to be outside the node {...} elements
    dockerImage = "corda/corda-zulu-java1.8-4.6"
}
```

{{< note >}}
If you do not specify the sshd port number for a node, it will use the default value `2222`.
{{< /note >}}

2. To create the nodes defined in the `prepareDockerNodes` gradle task added in the first step, run the following command in a command prompt or a terminal window, from the root of the project where the `prepareDockerNodes` task is defined:

* Linux/macOS: `./gradlew prepareDockerNodes`
* Windows: `gradlew.bat prepareDockerNodes`

This command creates the nodes in the `build/nodes` directory. A node directory is generated for each node defined in the `prepareDockerNodes` task. The task also creates a `docker-compose.yml` file in the `build/nodes` directory.

{{< note >}}
**External database configuration**

If you configure an external database, a `Postgres_Dockerfile` file and `Postgres_init.sh` file are also generated in the `build` directory. If you make any changes to your CorDapp source or `prepareDockerNodes` task, you will need to re-run the task to see the changes take effect.

If the external database is not defined and configured properly, as described in [specifying an external database](#specify-an-external-database), the files `Postgres_Dockerfile` and `Postgres_init.sh` will not be generated.

In this case, each Corda node is associated with a Postgres database. Only one Corda node can connect to the same database. While there is no maximum number of nodes you can deploy with `Dockerform`, you are constrained by the maximum available resources on the machine running this task, as well as the overhead introduced by every Docker container that is started. All the started nodes run in the same Docker overlay network.

The connection settings to the Postgres database are provided to each node through the `postgres.gradle` file. The Postgres JDBC driver is provided via Maven as part of the `cordaDrive` gradle configuration, which is also specified in the dependencies block of the `postgres.gradle` file.

Note that this feature is not designed for users to access the database via elevated or admin rights - you must only use such configuration changes for testing/development purposes.
