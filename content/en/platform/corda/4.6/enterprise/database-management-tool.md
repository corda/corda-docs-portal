# Database Management Tool

{{< warning >}}
Corda Enterprise 4.6.3 fixes a security vulnerability in the JPA notary. Before upgrading to Corda Enterprise 4.6.3 please read the guidance on [upgrading your notary service](notary/upgrading-the-ha-notary-service.md/).
{{< /warning >}}

The database management tool is distributed as a standalone JAR file named `tools-database-manager-${corda_version}.jar`.
It is intended to be used by Corda Enterprise node administrators who want more control over database changes made in production
environments.

The following sections document the available subcommands suitable for a node operator or database administrator.

{{< note >}}
The database management tool is for production databases only. H2 databases cannot be upgraded using the Database Management tool.
{{< /note >}}

## Options

* `-v, --verbose, --log-to-console`: If set, prints logging to the console as well as to a file.
* `--logging-level=<loggingLevel>`: Enable logging at this level and higher.
    * Possible values: `ERROR`, `WARN`, `INFO`, `DEBUG`, `TRACE`.
    * Default: `INFO`.
* `--config-obfuscation-passphrase[=<cliPassphrase>]`: The passphrase used in the key derivation function when generating an AES key.
* `--config-obfuscation-seed[=<cliSeed>]`: The seed used in the key derivation function to create a salt.
* `-h, --help`: See a list of available commands and descriptions.
* `-V, --version`: Print version information.

## Commands:

* `dry-run` Output the database migration to the specified output file.
* `execute-migration` Run the database migration on the configured database.
* `sync-app-schemas` Update the migration change log for all available CorDapps. When the tool runs with this sub-command against a node, the node will add entries to the Liquibase changelog for any CorDapp custom schema migrations that are available in the cordapps node folder and are not already
present in the change log.
* `create-migration-sql-for-cordapp` Create migration files for a CorDapp.
* `release-lock` Releases whatever locks are on the database change log table, in case shutdown failed.
* `install-shell-extensions` Install alias and autocompletion for bash and zsh.

## Allow obfuscated passwords

The DB Tool must be able to de-obfuscate the obfuscated fields.
The following command line options are provided for setting the passphrase and seed if necessary.

* `--config-obfuscation-passphrase`.
* `--config-obfuscation-seed`.

## Execute a dry run of the SQL migration scripts

The `dry-run` subcommand can be used to output the database migration to the specified output file or to the console. The output file is created relative to the current working directory.

Usage:

```shell
database-manager dry-run [-hvV] [--doorman-jar-path=<doormanJarPath>]
                         [--logging-level=<loggingLevel>] [--mode=<mode>]
                         -b=<baseDirectory> [-f=<configFile>] [<outputFile>]
```

The `outputFile` parameter can be optionally specified determine what file to output the generated SQL to, or use
`CONSOLE` to output to the console.

Additional options:

* `--base-directory`, `-b`: (Required) The node working directory where all the files are kept. This defaults to the current working directory if not set.
* `--config-file`, `-f`: The path to the config file. Defaults to `node.conf`.
* `--mode`: The operating mode. Possible values: NODE, DOORMAN, JPA_NOTARY. Default: NODE.
* `--doorman-jar-path=<doormanJarPath>`: The path to the doorman (Identity Manager) `.jar` file.
* `--verbose`, `--log-to-console`, `-v`: If set, prints logging to the console as well as to a file.
* `--logging-level=<loggingLevel>`: Enable logging at this level and higher. Possible values: ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, TRACE. Default: INFO.
* `--core-schemas`: Output DB-specific DDL to apply the core node schema migrations.
* `--app-schemas`: Output DB-specific DDL to apply the migrations for custom CorDapp schemas.
* `--help`, `-h`: See a list of available commands and descriptions.
* `--version`, `-V`: Print version information.


## Executing SQL migration scripts

The `execute-migration` subcommand runs migration scripts on the node’s database.

Usage:

```shell
database-manager execute-migration [-hvV] [--doorman-jar-path=<doormanJarPath>]
                                   [--logging-level=<loggingLevel>]
                                   [--mode=<mode>] -b=<baseDirectory>
                                   [-f=<configFile>]
```


* `--base-directory`, `-b`: (Required) The node working directory where all the files are kept. This defaults to the current working directory if not set.
* `--config-file`, `-f`: The path to the config file. Defaults to `node.conf`.
* `--mode`: The operating mode. Possible values: NODE, DOORMAN, JPA_NOTARY. Default: NODE.
* `--doorman-jar-path=<doormanJarPath>`: The path to the doorman (Identity Manager) `.jar` file.
* `--verbose`, `--log-to-console`, `-v`: If set, prints logging to the console as well as to a file.
* `--logging-level=<loggingLevel>`: Enable logging at this level and higher. Possible values: ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, TRACE. Default: INFO.
* `--core-schemas`: Run Liquibase migrations for the node core schema.
* `--app-schemas`: Run Liquibase migrations for custom CorDapp schemas.
* `--db-admin-config <path/to/adminconfigfile>`: Specify the location on disk of a configuration file holding elevated access credentials for the DB. The DB Management tool will use the credentials listed in the configuration file to connect to the node database and apply the changes. The configuration file supports the following fields:
  * `dbAdminUser`.
  * `dbAdminPassword`.
* `--help`, `-h`: See a list of available commands and descriptions.
* `--version`, `-V`: Print version information.


## Releasing database locks

The `release-lock` subcommand forces the release of database locks. Sometimes, when a node or the database management
tool crashes while running migrations, Liquibase will not release the lock. This can happen during some long
database operations, or when an admin kills the process (this cannot happen during normal operation of a node,
only [during the migration process](http://www.liquibase.org/documentation/databasechangeloglock_table.html).

Usage:

```shell
database-manager release-lock [-hvV] [--doorman-jar-path=<doormanJarPath>]
                              [--logging-level=<loggingLevel>] [--mode=<mode>]
                              -b=<baseDirectory> [-f=<configFile>]
```

Additional options:

* `--base-directory`, `-b`: (Required) The node working directory where all the files are kept (default: `.`).
* `--config-file`, `-f`: The path to the config file. Defaults to `node.conf`.
* `--mode`: The operating mode. Possible values: NODE, DOORMAN, JPA_NOTARY. Default: NODE.
* `--doorman-jar-path=<doormanJarPath>`: The path to the doorman JAR.
* `--verbose`, `--log-to-console`, `-v`: If set, prints logging to the console as well as to a file.
* `--logging-level=<loggingLevel>`: Enable logging at this level and higher. Possible values: ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, TRACE. Default: INFO.
* `--help`, `-h`: See a list of available commands and descriptions.
* `--version`, `-V`: Print version information.


## Database Manager shell extensions

The `install-shell-extensions` subcommand can be used to install the `database-manager` alias and auto completion for
bash and zsh. See [Shell extensions for CLI Applications]({{% ref "node/operating/cli-application-shell-extensions.md" %}}) for more info.

{{< note >}}
When running the database management tool, it is preferable to use absolute paths when specifying the “base-directory”.
{{< /note >}}

{{< warning >}}
It is good practice for node operators to back up the database before upgrading to a new version.

Advice: See [this StackOverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15528795/liquibase-lock-reasons).
Run the following command to force Liquibase to give up the lock:

```
java -jar tools-database-manager-4.0.jar --base-directory /path/to/node --release-lock
```
