# Getting set up for CorDapp development

There are four pieces of required software for CorDapp development: the Java 8 JDK, IntelliJ IDEA, Git, and Gradle.

## Installing the Java 8 JDK

Install the Java 8 JDK. Corda requires at least version 8u171, but do not currently support Java 9 or higher for this version of Corda.

Corda has been tested against the following Java builds:

  * [Oracle JDK](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
  * [Amazon Corretto](https://aws.amazon.com/corretto/)
  * [Red Hat’s OpenJDK](https://developers.redhat.com/products/openjdk/overview/)
  * [Zulu’s OpenJDK](https://www.azul.com/)

{{< note >}}
  OpenJDK builds often exclude JavaFX, which is required by the Corda GUI tools. Corda supports only Java 8.

If you are using Windows, you must also add Java to the PATH environment variable by following the instructions in the [Oracle documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/webnotes/install/windows/jdk-installation-windows.html#path).

## Installing the IntelliJ IDEA

IntelliJ is an IDE that offers strong support for Kotlin and Java development.

Install the [IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/). Corda supports IntelliJ IDEA versions **2017.x**, **2018.x**, **2019.x**, and **2020.x**; and Kotlin plugin version 1.2.71.


To install IntelliJ IDEA in a Ubuntu environment, navigate to the [Jetbrains IntelliJ snap package](https://snapcraft.io/intellij-idea-community).

## Installing Git

We use Git to host our sample CorDapp and provide version control.

To install Git, navigate to [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and install your preferred version, depending on your OS.

## Installing Gradle

If you intend to proceed directly to run a sample CorDapp, as described in [Running a sample CorDapp](tutorial-cordapp.md), the included `gradlew` script should install Gradle automatically when you open the sample CorDapp in IntelliJ.

If you'd prefer to install Gradle manually, navigate to [Gradle](https://gradle.org/releases/) then locate and install Gradle **version 5.6.4**. Corda requires a Gradle version between 5.1 and 5.6.4, and does not support Gradle 6.x.

## Next steps

First, run the [sample CorDapp](tutorial-cordapp.md).

Next, read through the [Corda Key Concepts](key-concepts.md) to understand how Corda works.

By then, you’ll be ready to start writing your own CorDapps. You may want to refer to the
API documentation, the [flow cookbook](flow-cookbook.md) and the
[samples](https://www.corda.net/samples/) along the way.

If you encounter any issues, please ask on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/corda) or via [our Slack channels](http://cordaledger.slack.com/).
