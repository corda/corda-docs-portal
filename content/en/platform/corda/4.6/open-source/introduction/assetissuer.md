# Issuing an asset

Business networks are typically created to transact a specific asset type or to trade a generic asset within a specific context. In either case there is at least one asset issuer (for example a bank) who is responsible for creating assets onto the ledger. The user who has signing authority for the creation of the assets is the asset issuer. There may be multiple asset issuers in the business network issuing different instances of the same asset type or potentially different asset types. In some cases, such as trade finance, any party may be an asset issuer at some point.
