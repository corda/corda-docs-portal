# The Archive Service V1.0.1

The Archive Service allows you to make an archive of transactions and attachments from the Corda vault which can no longer
be part of an ongoing or new transaction flow. This can reduce pressure on your node's database, and declutter your vault.

You can use Archive service commands to mark archivable items in your vault, archive them, and restore transactions from the archive when necessary.

The Archive Service consists of the following:

* [**Archive Service CorDapp**](#archive-service-cordapp)- which contains the necessary flows to mark and archive transactions.
* [**Archive Service Client Library**](archive-library) - which provides programmatic access to the archive service, and [exposes relevant APIs](archiving-apis).
* [**Archive Service Command Line Interface**](archiving-cli) - which allows you to perform archiving tasks from the command line.

It also makes use of the [Application Entity Manager](app-entity-manager) - which allows CorDapps to access off-ledger databases using JPA APIs.

## New in V1.0.1

The Archive Service is compatible with [Ledger Graph V1.2.1 On Demand function](#Archiving-and-onDemand-LedgerGraph).

## What can be archived

The Archive Service has commands you can use to identify which transactions can be archived in your vault. A fully consumed transaction or attachment will be marked as archivable when:

* There are no unconsumed transactions in the same LedgerGraph component. A LedgerGraph component is a connected group of transactions, represented as a Direct Acrylic Graph (DAG) in the [LedgerGraph service](../operating/ledger-graph).
* The transaction is not also referenced by another LedgerGraph component that contains unconsumed transactions.
* The attachment itself is not a contract attachment.

Archivable and non-archivable LedgerGraph components:

## When you can archive

Once the Archive Service has marked a transaction or attachment as archivable, you can safely archive it anytime without risk to any other member of your network. You do not need to inform other members of the network, and your archiving action will not affect their ledger.

### Archiving and Collaborative Recovery

The [Collaborative Recovery CorDapp **LedgerSync** V1.2.1](../collaborative-recovery/ledger-sync) has been introduced for compatibility with the Archive Service. If you or anyone on your network uses Collaborative Recovery to recover data after a disaster scenario, archived transactions in any nodes on the network are marked as such. This means they do not appear to be 'lost' or 'missing' data and will not be recovered automatically in the recovery process.

## Making archive-friendly CorDapps

The more transactions within a Ledger Graph component, the longer it may take for a related transaction to become archivable. If you wish to create CorDapps that produce regularly archivable transactions, there are some steps you can take in your design process to help this.

Some characteristics of a good ‘archive-friendly’ CorDapp are:

* Short transaction chains that will get consumed in their entirety.
* Consumes and redeems ‘irrelevant states’ – for example if you store evolvable data it should be consumed even if it is no longer directly queried or used in a transaction.
* Avoids consuming outputs of one transaction via multiple transactions. This could mean ensuring fungible assets are distributed as narrowly as possible – rather than from multiple cash supplies.

## Archive Service CorDapp

The Archive Service CorDapp enables you to use the Archiving Service to identify and perform archiving tasks. Your configuration of the Archive Service CorDapp depends on your node database.

As part of the configuration process, you can choose to create a backup schema. This is a temporary snapshot image of archivable transactions that can be used to restore the vault if the archiving process fails.

### Requirements and compatibility

The Archive Service requires:

* Node minimum platform version 6.
* Corda Enterprise minimum version 4.4.
* [LedgerGraph V1.2](../operating/ledger-graph.md).
* Collaborative Recovery V 1.2 (if you use Collaborative Recovery).

{{< warning >}}
Archive Service V1.0.1 does not support **Accounts** or **Confidential Identities** functionality in Corda.
{{< /warning >}}

## Installation

The Archive Service CorDapp .jar file should be copied to the node's `cordapps` directory. The Ledger Service CorDapp .jar file
must also be copied to the same directory.

```text
corda@CrimsonSolo:/opt/corda/node$ ls -l cordapps/
drwxr-xr-x 2 corda corda   4096 Aug 26 06:43 config
-rw-r--r-- 1 corda corda 504538 Aug 26 06:35 archive-service-1.0.1.jar
-rw-r--r-- 1 corda corda 161260 Jul 30 05:04 ledger-graph-1.2.1.jar
```

## Configuration

The Archive Service CorDapp is configured using a HOCON configuration file located in the `config` sub-directory
of node's `cordapps` directory. The configuration file must have the same name and version as the CorDapp but
with the `jar` suffix changed to `conf`.

```text
corda@CrimsonSolo:/opt/corda/node$ ls -l cordapps/config
total 12
-rw-r--r-- 1 corda corda 469 Aug 26 06:43 archive-service-1.0.1.conf
```

The Archive Service configuration file provides the database connection details used by the service to
record a temporary snapshot of the vault data.

The following are keys for configuring the Archive Service:

* `generator` - SQL generator, defaults to vault's database type.
* `driver` - JDBC driver, defaults to vault's database driver.
* `source.schema` - Vault schema name, defaults to vault database schema.
* `target.schema` - Backup schema name, optional, indicates that a backup schema should be created.
* `target.url` - Backup schema archive URL, required if a backup schema is used.
* `target.user` - Backup schema archive database user, required if a backup schema is used.
* `target.password` - Backup schema archive database password, required if a backup schema is used.

Passwords can be obfuscated using Corda's Config Obfuscator tool.

The following is a sample configuration file:

```text
generator: PostgresGenerator
driver: "org.postgresql.Driver"

target: {
    url: "jdbc:postgresql:postgres"
    user: "archive"
    password: "<{HNtZpbrOGM6GhYA6foh5PCCBanUtaebCjauKL8ur9EE=:PolqmEJ7JOM+Sqj3ZNAE+Ew9bqG1wVE=}>"
    schema: "archive"
}
```

## Using the backup schema

you can configure the archiving process to create a temporary snapshot image of the archivable transactions
and attachments from your Corda vault on a backup schema within the same database. This snapshot can then be used
to restore the vault should the database fail during the archiving operation.

For the backup schema to work, the Corda vault schema and the archive schema must reside on the same database but be
managed by different schema owners.

The Archive Service uses a separate JPA entity manager factory to manage the
archive schema and copy data from the Corda schema to the archive schema.

To create a copy of the vault on the backup schema the backup schema owner must have
`SELECT` rights to the vault schema.

To restore the vault from a copy on the backup schema the backup schema owner must
either have `INSERT` rights to the vault schema or the `restore-snapshot` command has to be executed with the
`--record` option.

The `--record` option allows the user to capture the SQL to a file so that it can be
executed by a database administrator who has the sufficient rights.

The following sections contain sample SQL statements needed for creating a backup schema user.
In these examples the backup schema is called `archive` and the vault schema is `corda`.

### Postgres

The following DDL statements can be used to create a backup schema user `archive`:

```
create user archive password 'archive';
create schema archive AUTHORIZATION archive;
grant usage on schema corda to archive;
grant select on all tables in schema corda to archive;
grant insert on all tables in schema corda to archive;
```

### Oracle

The following DDL statements can be used to create a backup schema user `archive`:

```
create user archive identified by archive2 DEFAULT TABLESPACE users QUOTA unlimited ON users;
grant CONNECT, RESOURCE to archive;
```

Oracle does not have a single grant option to provide rights to all the tables in a schema.
This means that rights have to be current on a per table basis.

```
grant select, insert on corda.NODE_TRANSACTIONS to archive;
```

### MSSQL
The following DDL statements can be used to create a backup schema user `archive`:

```
create login archive with password = 'Archive123';
create schema archive;
create user archive for login archive with default_schema = archive;
grant SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, VIEW DEFINITION, ALTER, REFERENCES on schema::archive TO archive;
grant CREATE TABLE to archive;
grant CREATE VIEW to archive;
grant SELECT on schema ::corda to archive;
grant INSERT on schema ::corda to archive;
```

## Restarting the node

It is sometimes necessary to restart the node when carrying out an archiving job.

You need to restart the node:

* Before running import-snapshot, having run 'delete-snapshot' (archive schema has been deleted, and now the vault is to be restored from file archive).
* After 'delete-vault' has been run using the '--record' option.
* After 'restore-snapshot' has been run using the '--record' option.

## Archive Service command-line tool

The command-line tool is a 'fat-jar' that can be executed directly using the `java -jar` option.

```text
$ java -jar corda-tools-archive-service-1.0.1.jar --help
archive-service [--config-obfuscation-passphrase[=<cliPassphrase>]]

A detailed explanation on each sub-command can be found in the [Archive Service CLI documentation](archiving-cli.md).

## Filters

Filters can be used to limit which transactions and attachments are available for archiving.
They are applied on the command line of the `list-items` or `create-snapshot` commands
or alternatively recorded in the CorDapp configuration file.

Each filter has its own configuration requirements, which it takes either from the HOCON file given on the
command line or from the CorDapp configuration file.

Custom filters can be implemented by using the Archive Service Library.
For more details see the [Archive Service Library documentation](archive-library.md).

### Filter configuration

The following is a sample HOCON configuration file that can be used to configure the standard TransactionId filter.

{{< note >}}
Transactions are filtered *out* of the results set. So, transactions that are filtered using this configuration are excluded from the archiving process.
{{< /note >}}

```text
filter: {
    // A list of filters to be applied
    filters: [
        "TransactionIdFilter"
    ]

    // Configuration for the TransactionIdFilter filter
    transactionIdFilter: {
        transactions: [
            "1234567812345678123456781234567812345678123456781234567812345678"
        ]
    }
}
```

The following HOCON example can be used to configure the standard Party filter:

```
filter: {
    // A list of filters to be applied
    filters: [
        "PartyFilter"
    ]

    // Configuration for the PartyFilter filter
    partyFilter.parties: [
     “O=PartyA,L=London,C=GB”
    ]
   }
```

## Exporters

Exporters are used to copy the archive snapshot from the vault to a permanent archive.
The exporters to be applied can be given on the command line to the `export-snapshot` command
or recorded in the CorDapp configuration file.

```
exporter: {
    exporters: [
        "ZippedFileExporter",
        "QueryableStateFileExporter"
    ]
}
```

By default no exporters are applied.

Each exporter has its own configuration requirements, which it takes either from the HOCON file given on the
command line or from the CorDapp configuration file.

Custom exporters can be implemented for individual archive solutions.
For more details see the [Archive Service Library documentation](archive-library.md).

## Queryable state tables

Queryable state tables can be exported to CSV format by listing the tables by listing the tables in
the configuration file under the property `queryableTables`.

```text
queryableTables: [
    "LOAN_STATES"
]
```

The property can be added to the Archive Service CorDapp configuration file, or passed within the
`create-snapshot` command configuration.

A suitable exporter, such as `QueryableStateFileExporter`, must also be listed on the command line to `export-snapshot`.

## Additional tables

Archive Service will automatically detect transaction and attachment tables which use the columns
`TRANSACTION_ID` or `ATT_ID` within the vault schema and include them in the archive process.

Additional transaction and attachment tables which use different column names can be registered using the
properties `additionalTransactionTables` and `additionalAttachmentTables` with the following format.

```text
additionalTransactionTables: [
    "ACCOUNT_STATE:TX_ID",
]
additionalAttachmentTables: [
    "ATTACHMENT_INFO:ATTACHMENT_ID"
]
```

Data from these tables will be recorded as part of the snapshot process and later deleted from the vault,
but will not be exported to permanent archive.

Tables should be excluded from the archive process can be registered using the
properties `excludeTransactionTables` and `excludeAttachmentTables`.
