# Corda Enterprise Edition 4.8 release notes

## Corda Enterprise Edition 4.8.10 release notes

Corda Enterprise Edition 4.8.10 is a patch release of Corda Enterprise focused on resolving issues.

### Upgrade recommendation

As a developer or node operator, you should upgrade to the [latest released version of Corda](../enterprise.html) as soon as possible. The latest Corda Enterprise release notes are on this page, and you can find the latest upgrade guide [here](upgrading-index.md).

### Fixed issues

* Previously, when configured to use confidential identities and the Securosys PrimusX HSM, it was possible for Corda to fail to generate a wrapped key-pair for a new confidential identity. This would cause a temporary key-pair to be leaked, consuming resources in the HSM. This issue occurred when:

  * The Securosys HSM was configured in a master-clone cluster.

  * The master HSM had failed and Corda had failed-over to use the clone HSM.

  * There was an attempt to create a transaction using confidential identities.

  The issue is now resolved. When generating a wrapped key-pair, the temporary key-pair is not persisted in the HSM and thus cannot be leaked.

  On applying this update, it is recommended that the PrimusX JCE should be upgraded to version 2.3.4 or later for optimum performance of the HSM. If the JCE is not updated, then no keys are leaked but they are temporarily created in the HSM and are then garbage-collected within 24 hours.

  There is no need to upgrade the HSM firmware version for this update, but it is recommended to keep the firmware up to date as a matter of course. Currently the latest firmware version is 2.8.50.

## Corda Enterprise Edition 4.8.9 release notes

Corda Enterprise Edition 4.8.9 is a patch release of Corda Enterprise focused on resolving issues.

### Upgrade recommendation

As a developer or node operator, you should upgrade to the [latest released version of Corda](../enterprise.html) as soon as possible. The latest Corda Enterprise release notes are on this page, and you can find the latest upgrade guide [here](upgrading-index.md).

### Fixed issues

* For CENM 1.4+, the `getNodeInfos()` bulk fetch mechanism now retrieves NodeInfos from the network map via an HTTP proxy, if a proxy has been configured.

## Corda Enterprise Edition 4.8.8 release notes

Corda Enterprise Edition 4.8.8 is a patch release of Corda Enterprise focused on CorDapp response time and security improvements.

### Upgrade recommendation

As a developer or node operator, you should upgrade to the [latest released version of Corda](../enterprise.html) as soon as possible. The latest Corda Enterprise release notes are on this page, and you can find the latest upgrade guide [here](upgrading-index.md).

### Fixed issues

In this patch release:
* Java serialization has been disabled in the Corda firewall, closing a potential security vulnerability.
* The time it takes for first-time flows to be run in a signed CorDapp has been significantly reduced. This was achieved by fixing a regression introduced in Corda Enterprise Edition 4.8 involving the `ServiceLoader` used to load the `SerializationWhitelist`.

## Long-term support release

[Corda 4.8](https://github.com/corda/corda-docs-portal/blob/main/content/en/archived-docs/corda-os/4.8/release-notes.md) and Corda Enterprise Edition 4.8 are our long-term support (LTS) platform versions.

R3 provides LTS for this release for 30 months starting April 21st 2021. This is 6 months longer than the support periods for previous releases, giving Corda customers extra time to plan for the next upgrade.

## Platform version change

Corda 4.8 uses platform version 10.

For more information about platform versions, see [Versioning](../../../../../en/platform/corda/4.8/enterprise/cordapps/versioning.md).

## New features and enhancements

### Notary database support update

The [JPA notary](../../../../../en/platform/corda/4.8/enterprise/notary/installing-jpa.md) now supports [Oracle DB version 19c](../../../../../en/platform/corda/4.8/enterprise/platform-support-matrix.html#jpa-notary-databases). This database is supported until April 30th 2027.

### Azure managed identities authentication

If you use an Azure Key Vault HSM with Corda Enterprise, you can now use an existing Azure Managed Identities service as authentication.

See [Using an HSM with Corda Enterprise](../../../../../en/platform/corda/4.8/enterprise/node/operating/cryptoservice-configuration.html#azure-keyvault) for more information.

### Time-window metrics gathering

You can now configure timer and histogram metrics to use time-window data gathering. Time-window data gathering collects all data points for a given time window, allowing outlying data points to be properly represented.

See [Node metrics](node/operating/monitoring-and-logging/node-metrics.md) for more information.

### Additional notary metrics

You can use `StartupQueueTime` and `BatchSignLatency` metrics to help calculate notary latency and assess notary worker performance across a notary cluster.

* `StartupQueueTime` represents the time a flow has been queued before starting, in milliseconds.
* `BatchSignLatency` represents the time elapsed during a batch signature, in milliseconds.

See [Monitoring Notary Latency](notary/faq/notary-latency-monitoring.md) for more information.


## Fixed issues

Corda Enterprise Edition 4.8 fixes:

* A security issue that affects notary systems that use the JPA notary implementation in an HA configuration and when the notary backing database has been set up using the Corda database management tool. The new version of the Corda [database management tool](../../../../../en/platform/corda/4.8/enterprise/database-management-tool.md) must be re-run for the fix to take effect.
* Several issues that cause memory leaks. As a result, we have added a new node configuration field - `enableURLConnectionCache` - and we have modified the `attachmentClassLoaderCacheSize` node configuration field. See the [node configuration fields page](../../../../../en/platform/corda/4.8/enterprise/node/setup/corda-configuration-fields.html#enterpriseconfiguration) for details.
* An issue where the node is unable to resolve transaction chains that contain states or contracts that it did not relate to installed CorDapps.
* Flow state, invocation source, and suspension source filters breaking in the node GUI.
* Transaction verification being performed outside of the attachments class loader.
* HA utilities not logging messages that state that the master key is not needed when using a native mode HSM.
* HA utilities not logging information about the `freshIdentitiesConfiguration`.
* Log messages incorrectly stating that a confidential identity key has been created.
* An issue that causes the node to hang if shut down using `SIGTERM`.
* Attachment presence cache containing the attachment contents.
* The Corda Firewall throwing an error when retrieving version information.
* HA utilities creating erroneous logs when using confidential identities.

## Known issues

* An issue with the Oracle 12c database that causes the JDBC driver to hang if blocked by an empty entropy pool.
