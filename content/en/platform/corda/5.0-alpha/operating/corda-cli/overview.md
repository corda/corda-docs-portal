The Corda CLI is a command line tool which provides tooling for working with Corda clusters.
The [CSDE](../../getting-started/cordapp-standard-development-environment/csde.html) can handle standard calls to the Corda CLI.
However, if you prefer, you can perform command line instructions directly, as described in the [next section](commands.html).
Installing the Corda CLI is described [here](../../getting-started/installing-corda-cli.html) in the Getting Started section.
