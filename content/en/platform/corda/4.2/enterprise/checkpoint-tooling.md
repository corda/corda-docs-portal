# Checkpoint Tooling

This page contains information about checkpoint tooling.

Before reading this page, please ensure you understand the mechanics and principles of Corda Flows by reading [Flows](key-concepts-flows.md) and [Writing flows](flow-state-machines.md).
It is also recommended that you understand the purpose and behaviour of the [Flow Hospital](node-flow-hospital.md) in relation to *checkpoints* and flow recovery.
An advanced explanation of *checkpoints* within the flow state machine can be found here: contributing-flow-internals.

{{< note >}}
As a recap,

A flow *checkpoint* is a serialised snapshot of the flow’s stack frames and any objects reachable from the stack. Checkpoints are saved to
the database automatically when a flow suspends or resumes, which typically happens when sending or receiving messages. A flow may be replayed
from the last checkpoint if the node restarts. Automatic checkpointing is an unusual feature of Corda and significantly helps developers write
reliable code that can survive node restarts and crashes. It also assists with scaling up, as flows that are waiting for a response can be flushed
from memory.

## Checkpoint dumper

The checkpoint dumper outputs information about flows running on a node. This is useful for diagnosing the causes of stuck flows. Using the generated output,
corrective actions can be taken to resolve the issues flows are facing. One possible solution, is ending a flow using the `flow kill` command.


{{< warning >}}
Deleting checkpoints manually or via `flow kill`/`killFlow` can lead to an inconsistent ledger among transacting parties. Great care
and coordination with a flow’s counterparties must be taken to ensure that a initiating flow and flows responding to it are correctly
removed. This experience will be improved in the future. Making it easier to kill flows while notifying their counterparties.

{{< /warning >}}


To retrieve this information, execute `run dumpCheckpoints` in the node’s shell. The command creates a zip and generates a JSON file for each flow.


* Each file follows the naming format `<flow name>-<flow id>.json` (for example, `CashIssueAndPaymentFlow-90613d6f-be78-41bd-98e1-33a756c28808.json`).
* The zip is placed into the `logs` directory of the node and is named `checkpoints_dump-<date and time>.zip` (for example, `checkpoints_dump-20190812-153847`).

Below are some of the more important fields included in the output:


* `flowId`: The id of the flow.
* `topLevelFlowClass`: The name of the original flow that was invoked (by RPC or a service).
* `topLevelFlowLogic`: Detailed view of the top level flow.
* `flowCallStackSummary`: A summarised list of the current stack of sub flows along with any progress tracker information.
* `suspendedOn`: The command that the flow is suspended on (for example, `SendAndReceive`), which includes the `suspendedTimestamp`.
* `flowCallStack` A detailed view of the of the current stack of sub flows.



### Sample output

Below is an example of the JSON output:

```json

## Flow diagnostic process

Lets assume a scenario where we have triggered a flow in a node (eg. node acting as a flow initiator) but the flow does not appear to complete.

For example, you may see the following using the CRaSH shell `flow watch` command:

```none
Id                                Flow name                                                           Initiator                        Status
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
15f16740-4ea2-4e48-bcb3-fd9051d5b Cash Issue And Payment                                              bankUser                         In progress
1c6c3e59-26aa-4b93-8435-4e34e265e Cash Issue And Payment                                              bankUser                         In progress
90613d6f-be78-41bd-98e1-33a756c28 Cash Issue And Payment                                              bankUser                         In progress
43c7d5c8-aa66-4a98-beed-dc91354d0 Cash Issue And Payment                                              bankUser                         In progress
Waiting for completion or Ctrl-C ...
```

Note that “In progress” indicates the flows above have not completed (and will have been checkpointed).


* Check the main corda node log file for *hospitalisation* and/or *flow retry* messages: `<NODE_BASE>\logs\node-<hostname>.log`

```none
[INFO ] 2019-07-11T17:56:43,227Z [pool-12-thread-1] statemachine.FlowMonitor. - Flow with id 90613d6f-be78-41bd-98e1-33a756c28808 has been waiting for 97904 seconds to receive messages from parties [O=BigCorporation, L=New York, C=US].
```

{{< note >}}
Always search for the flow id, in this case **90613d6f-be78-41bd-98e1-33a756c28808**

{{< /note >}}

* From the CRaSH shell run the `dumpCheckpoints` command to trigger diagnostics information.

```none
Welcome to the Corda interactive shell.
Useful commands include 'help' to see what is available, and 'bye' to shut down the node.

Thu Jul 11 18:56:48 BST 2019>>> run dumpCheckpoints
```

An additional file will appear in the nodes logs directory:


* `<NODE_BASE>\logs\checkpoints_dump-20190711-180247.zip`


* Unzip the `<NODE_BASE>\logs\checkpoints_dump-<date>.zip` file, and you should see a file with a matching flow id as above:
**CashIssueAndPaymentFlow-90613d6f-be78-41bd-98e1-33a756c28808.json**Its contents will contain the following diagnostics information:
