# Database management

The Corda platform, and the installed CorDapps store their data in a relational database.

Corda Enterprise supports a range of commercial 3rd party databases: Azure SQL, SQL Server, Oracle and PostgreSQL.

The documentation contains the required database user permission and schema creation steps
for production systems [Database schema setup](node-database-admin.md) for a new Corda installation
or [Database upgrade](node-upgrade-notes.md#node-upgrade-notes-update-database-ref) for upgrading Corda nodes.
Database schema updates may be also required when [Deploying CorDapps on a node](node-operations-cordapp-deployment.md)
or [Upgrading CorDapps on a node](node-operations-upgrade-cordapps.md).

For development/testing purposes [Simplified database schema setup for development](node-database-developer.md) covers database setup with simplified user permissions.
[Node database](node-database.md) explains the differences between both setups.

Corda Enterpise is released with the [Database Management Tool](node-database.md#database-management-tool-ref).
The tool is distributed as a standalone JAR file named `tools-database-manager-${corda_version}.jar`.
It is intended to be used by Corda Enterprise node administrators during database schema creation.

It can be also used by CorDapp developers as a helper to create Liquibase database migration scripts.
Any CorDapp deployed onto a Corda Enteprise node, which stores data in a custom tables,
requires embedded DDL scripts written in a cross database manner [Database management scripts](database-management.md).
