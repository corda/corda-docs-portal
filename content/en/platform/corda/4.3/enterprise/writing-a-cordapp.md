# Structuring a CorDapp




## Modules

The source code for a CorDapp is divided into one or more modules, each of which will be compiled into a separate JAR.
Together, these JARs represent a single CorDapp. Typically, a Cordapp contains all the classes required for it to be
used standalone. However, some Cordapps are only libraries for other Cordapps and cannot be run standalone.

A common pattern is to have:


* One module containing only the CorDapp’s contracts and/or states, as well as any required dependencies
* A second module containing the remaining classes that depend on these contracts and/or states

This is because each time a contract is used in a transaction, the entire JAR containing the contract’s definition is
attached to the transaction. This is to ensure that the exact same contract and state definitions are used when
verifying this transaction at a later date. Because of this, you will want to keep this module, and therefore the
resulting JAR file, as small as possible to reduce the size of your transactions and keep your node performant.

However, this two-module structure is not prescriptive:


* A library CorDapp containing only contracts and states would only need a single module
* In a CorDapp with multiple sets of contracts and states that **do not** depend on each other, each independent set of
contracts and states would go in a separate module to reduce transaction size
* In a CorDapp with multiple sets of contracts and states that **do** depend on each other, either keep them in the
same module or create separate modules that depend on each other
* The module containing the flows and other classes can be structured in any way because it is not attached to
transactions


## Template CorDapps

You should base your project on one of the following templates:


* [Java Template CorDapp](https://github.com/corda/cordapp-template-java) (for CorDapps written in Java)
* [Kotlin Template CorDapp](https://github.com/corda/cordapp-template-kotlin) (for CorDapps written in Kotlin)

Please use the branch of the template that corresponds to the major version of Corda you are using. For example,
someone building a CorDapp on Corda 4.1 should use the `release-V4` branch of the template.


### Build system

The templates are built using Gradle. A Gradle wrapper is provided in the `wrapper` folder, and the dependencies are
defined in the `build.gradle` files. See [Building and installing a CorDapp](cordapp-build-systems.md) for more information.

No templates are currently provided for Maven or other build systems.


### Modules

The templates are split into two modules:


* A `cordapp-contracts-states` module containing the contracts and states
* A `cordapp` module containing the remaining classes that depends on the `cordapp-contracts-states` module

These modules will be compiled into two JARs - a `cordapp-contracts-states` JAR and a `cordapp` JAR - which
together represent the Template CorDapp.


#### Module one - cordapp-contracts-states

Here is the structure of the `src` directory for the `cordapp-contracts-states` module of the Java template:

```none
.
└── main
    └── java
        └── com
            └── template
                ├── TemplateContract.java
                └── TemplateState.java
```

The directory only contains two class definitions:


* `TemplateContract`
* `TemplateState`

These are definitions for classes that we expect to have to send over the wire. They will be compiled into their own
CorDapp.


#### Module two - cordapp

Here is the structure of the `src` directory for the `cordapp` module of the Java template:

```none
.
├── main
│   ├── java
│   │   └── com
│   │       └── template
│   │           ├── TemplateApi.java
│   │           ├── TemplateClient.java
│   │           ├── TemplateFlow.java
│   │           ├── TemplateSerializationWhitelist.java
│   │           └── TemplateWebPlugin.java
│   └── resources
│       ├── META-INF
│       │   └── services
│       │       ├── net.corda.core.serialization.SerializationWhitelist
│       │       └── net.corda.webserver.services.WebServerPluginRegistry
│       ├── certificates
│       └── templateWeb
├── test
│   └── java
│       └── com
│           └── template
│               ├── ContractTests.java
│               ├── FlowTests.java
│               └── NodeDriver.java
└── integrationTest
    └── java
        └── com
            └── template
                └── DriverBasedTest.java
```

The `src` directory is structured as follows:


* `main` contains the source of the CorDapp
* `test` contains example unit tests, as well as a node driver for running the CorDapp from IntelliJ
* `integrationTest` contains an example integration test

Within `main`, we have the following directories:


* `java`, which contains the source-code for our CorDapp:>

    * `TemplateFlow.java`, which contains a template `FlowLogic` subclass
    * `TemplateState.java`, which contains a template `ContractState` implementation
    * `TemplateContract.java`, which contains a template `Contract` implementation
    * `TemplateSerializationWhitelist.java`, which contains a template `SerializationWhitelist` implementation
    * `TemplateApi.java`, which contains a template API for the deprecated Corda webserver
    * `TemplateWebPlugin.java`, which registers the API and front-end for the deprecated Corda webserver
    * `TemplateClient.java`, which contains a template RPC client for interacting with our CorDapp



* `resources/META-INF/services`, which contains various registries:>

    * `net.corda.core.serialization.SerializationWhitelist`, which registers the CorDapp’s serialisation whitelists
    * `net.corda.webserver.services.WebServerPluginRegistry`, which registers the CorDapp’s web plugins



* `resources/templateWeb`, which contains a template front-end

In a production CorDapp:


* We would remove the files related to the deprecated Corda webserver (`TemplateApi.java`,
`TemplateWebPlugin.java`, `resources/templateWeb`, and `net.corda.webserver.services.WebServerPluginRegistry`)
and replace them with a production-ready webserver
* We would also move `TemplateClient.java` into a separate module so that it is not included in the CorDapp
