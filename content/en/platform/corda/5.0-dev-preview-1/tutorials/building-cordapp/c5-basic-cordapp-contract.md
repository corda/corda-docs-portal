title: Write contracts
---

Contracts in the Corda 5 Developer Preview work in the same way as they did in Corda 4. In the context of a CorDapp, contracts define rules that are used to verify transaction inputs and outputs. A CorDapp can have more than one contract, and each contract defines rules for one or more states. The goal of a contract is to ensure that input and output states in transactions are valid and to prevent invalid transactions. All parties wishing to transact in a network must run the same contract(s) for any transaction they’re a party to, verifying that the transaction is valid.

Contract files implement the contract interface, containing the `verify` method. The `verify` method takes transactions as input and evaluates them against rules defined as a `requireThat` element. Contract execution is deterministic, and transaction acceptance is based on the transaction’s contents alone.

A transaction that is not contractually valid is not a valid proposal to update the ledger, and thus can never be committed to the ledger. In this way, contracts impose rules on the evolution of states over time that are independent of the willingness of the required signers to sign a given transaction.

This tutorial guides you through writing the two contracts you need in your CorDapp: `MarsVoucherContract` and `BoardingTicketContract`. You will link these contracts to the states that you created in the [Write the states](c5-basic-cordapp-state.md) tutorial.

You will create these contracts in the `contracts/src/main/<kotlin>/net/corda/missionMars/contracts/` directory in this tutorial. Refer to the `TemplateContract.kt` file in this directory to see a template contract.


## Learning objectives

Once you have completed this tutorial, you will know how to create and implement contracts in a Corda 5 Developer Preview CorDapp to restrict how your transaction flows are performed.


## Create the `MarsVoucherContract` contract

First, create the `MarsVoucherContract`. This contract verifies actions performed by the `MarsVoucher` state.

1. Right-click the **contracts** folder.

2. Select **New > Kotlin Class/File**.

3. In the **New Kotlin Class/File** window, select **Class** and name the file `MarsVoucherContract`.

{{< note >}}
When naming contracts, it’s best practice to match your contract and state names. In this case the contract is called `MarsVoucherContract`, and the state that links to it is called `MarsVoucher`. Follow this naming convention when you write an original CorDapp to avoid confusion.
{{< /note >}}

4. Open the file.


### Add the class name declaration

A Corda state typically has a corresponding contract class to document the rules/policy of that state when used in a transaction. To declare the contract class:

Add the class name `MarsVoucherContract` that implements the `Contract` class.

{{< note >}}
As you are writing the contract, you will notice that IntelliJ prompts you to add imports that correspond to elements you've added. Add the relevant imports to all suggested elements.
When adding imports, ignore `BoardingTicketContract` that is in red - you will add it in the *Create the `BoardingTicketContract`* section.
{{< /note >}}

This is what your code should look like now:

```kotlin
package net.corda.missionMars.contracts;

class MarsVoucherContract : Contract {

}
```

### Add commands

Commands indicate the transaction's intent — what type of actions performed by the state the contract can verify.

1. Add the `Commands : CommandData` interface declaration.

2. Inside the interface, add the `Issue` class that implements `Commands`.

   The `Issue` command is used to create the Mars voucher.

This is what your code should look like now:

```kotlin
package net.corda.missionMars.contracts;

class MarsVoucherContract : Contract {

  // Used to indicate the transaction's intent.
  interface Commands : CommandData {
      class Issue : Commands
  }

}
```

### Add the contract's ID

To identify your contract when building transactions, add its ID.

{{< note >}}
This ID is not used in the production environment, but it is used in the testing scenarios. It's best practice to add it to the contract.
{{< /note >}}

This is what your code should look like now:

```kotlin
package net.corda.missionMars.contracts;

class MarsVoucherContract : Contract {

  // Used to indicate the transaction's intent.
  interface Commands : CommandData {
      class Issue : Commands
  }

companion object {
    // This is used to identify our contract when building a transaction.
    const val ID = "com.tutorial.contracts.MarsVoucherContract"
  }
}
```

### Add the `verify` method

The `verify` method is automatically triggered when your transaction is executed. It verifies that the transaction components are following the restrictions implemented inside the contract's `verify` method.

1. If you're using IntelliJ, you will see an error indicator under the class name and implementation. This indicates that the class is missing the required method. Hover over the class definition, then:

   * On macOS: press **Option** + **Enter**.

   * On Windows: press **Alt** + **Enter**.

2. Click **Implement members**.

   The **Implement Members** window appears.

3. In the **Implement Members** window, select **verify(tx: LedgerTransaction): Unit**. Click **OK**.

4. Extract the command from the transaction.

5. Verify the transaction according to its intention using the Lambda `when-is` expression.

6. Implement domain-specific language (DSL) `requireThat` helper method to the `Issue` verification code.

{{< note >}}

This is a Corda-specific helper method used for writing contracts only.

{{< /note >}}


You have now finished writing the `MarsVoucherContract`. Your code should now look like this:

```kotlin
package net.corda.missionMars.contracts;

import net.corda.missionMars.states.MarsVoucher
import net.corda.v5.ledger.contracts.CommandData
import net.corda.v5.ledger.contracts.Contract
import net.corda.v5.ledger.contracts.requireThat
import net.corda.v5.ledger.transactions.LedgerTransaction

class MarsVoucherContract : Contract {

    override fun verify(tx: LedgerTransaction) {

        //Extract the command from the transaction.
        val commandData = tx.commands[0].value

        //Verify the transaction according to the intention of the transaction
        when (commandData) {
            is Commands.Issue -> requireThat {
                val output = tx.outputsOfType(MarsVoucher::class.java)[0]
                "This transaction should only have one MarsVoucher state as output".using(tx.outputs.size == 1)
                "The output MarsVoucher state should have clear description of the type of Space trip information".using(output.voucherDesc != "")
                null
            }
            is BoardingTicketContract.Commands.RedeemTicket-> requireThat {
                //Transaction verification will happen in BoardingTicket Contract
            }
        }
    }

    // Used to indicate the transaction's intent.
    interface Commands : CommandData {
        class Issue : Commands
    }

    companion object {
        // This is used to identify our contract when building a transaction.
        const val ID = "com.tutorial.contracts.MarsVoucherContract"
    }
}
```

## Create the `BoardingTicketContract`

Now that you've written your first contract, try writing the `BoardingTicketContract` using the following information.

The `BoardingTicketState` will be used on two occasions, which means that the `BoardingTicketContract` should have a `Commands` interface that carries two commands corresponding to the contract's two intentions:

* Mars Express creates the ticket to go to Mars. This intention is expressed by the `CreateTicket` command.
* Peter redeems the `BoardingTicket` state. This intention is expressed by the `RedeemTicket` command.

The rules inside the `requireThat` Corda DSL helper method are:

* For the `CreateTicket` command:

  * The transaction should only output one `BoardingTicket` state.
  * The output `BoardingTicket` state should have a clear description of the space trip.
  * The output `BoardingTicket` state should have a launch date later then the creation time.

* For the `RedeemTicket` command:

  * The transaction should consume two states.
  * The issuer of the `BoardingTicket` should be the space company that created the boarding ticket.
  * The output `BoardingTicket` state should have a launch date later than the creation time.


### Check your work

Once you've written the `BoardingTicketContract`, your code should look like this:

```kotlin
package net.corda.missionMars.contracts

import net.corda.missionMars.states.BoardingTicket

import net.corda.v5.ledger.contracts.CommandData

import java.util.*

class BoardingTicketContract : Contract {
    override fun verify(tx: LedgerTransaction) {
        //Extract the command from the transaction.
        val commandData = tx.commands[0].value
        val output = tx.outputsOfType(BoardingTicket::class.java)[0]

        when (commandData) {
            is Commands.CreateTicket -> requireThat {
                "This transaction should only output one BoardingTicket state".using(tx.outputs.size == 1)
                "The output BoardingTicket state should have clear description of space trip information".using(output.description != "")
                "The output BoardingTicket state should have a launching date later then the creation time".using(output.daysTillLaunch > 0)
                null
            }
            is Commands.RedeemTicket -> requireThat {
                val input = tx.inputsOfType(MarsVoucher::class.java)[0]
                "This transaction should consume two states".using(tx.inputStates.size == 2)
                "The issuer of the BoardingTicket should be the space company which creates the boarding ticket".using(input.issuer == output.marsExpress)
                "The output BoardingTicket state should have a launching date later then the creation time".using(output.daysTillLaunch > 0)
                null
            }
        }
    }

    // Used to indicate the transaction's intent.
    interface Commands : CommandData {
        class CreateTicket : Commands
        class RedeemTicket : Commands
    }

    companion object {
        // This is used to identify our contract when building a transaction.
        const val ID = "com.tutorial.contracts.BoardingTicketContract"
    }
}
```
