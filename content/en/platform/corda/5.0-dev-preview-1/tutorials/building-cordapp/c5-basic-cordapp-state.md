title: "Write states"
---

In Corda, states are immutable objects on the ledger that represent a fact known by one or more Corda nodes at a specific point in time. They can represent facts of any kind - for example, stocks, bonds, loans, and so on. States relevant to a specific node are stored in that node's vault. For a state to evolve, the current state must be marked as historic and a new, updated state must be created.

When you create a state, you include the relevant information about the fact you are storing. You also include a reference to the contract that governs how the states should evolve over time.

States in the Corda 5 Developer Preview are largely the same as states in Corda 4. A state still must implement `ContractState` or one of its dependents. The main difference when writing states with the Developer Preview is that you must add a <a href="#add-the-json-representable">`JsonRepresentable`</a>. This ensures that the output can be returned over RPC.

This tutorial guides you through writing the two states you need in your CorDapp: `MarsVoucher` and `BoardingTicket`. You will be creating these states in the `contracts/src/main/kotlin/net/corda/missionMars/states/` directory in this tutorial. Refer to the `TemplateState.kt` file in this directory to see a template state.

## Learning objectives

After you have completed this tutorial, you will know how to create and implement states in a Corda 5 Developer Preview CorDapp.

## Before you start

Before you start building states, read [Key concepts: States](../../cordapps/key-concepts/key-concepts-states.md).

## Clone the CorDapp template repo

The easiest way to write any CorDapp is to start from a template. This ensures that you have the correct files to begin building.

1. Navigate to the Kotlin template repository.
  * https://github.com/corda/corda5-cordapp-template-kotlin

2. Open a terminal window in the directory where you want to download the CorDapp template.

3. Run the command:

   ```kotlin
   git clone https://github.com/corda/corda5-cordapp-template-kotlin.git
   ```

4. After you have cloned the template repository, navigate to the correct subdirectory:

   ```kotlin
   cd cordapp-template-kotlin
   ```

5. Open `corda5-cordapp-template-kotlin` in [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).

   If you don't know how to open a CorDapp in IntelliJ, see the documentation on [Running a sample CorDapp](../run-demo-cordapp.html#open-the-sample-cordapp-in-intellij-idea).

6. [Rename the package](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/rename-refactorings.html#rename_package) to `missionMars`. This changes all instances of `template` in the project to `missionMars`

## Create the `MarsVoucher` state

First create the `MarsVoucher` state. This state is the voucher issued to customers.

1. Right-click the **states** folder, select **New > Kotlin Class/File**.

2. In the **New Kotlin Class/File** window, select **Class** and create a file called `MarsVoucher`.

3. Open the file.

### Add annotations

The first thing you should do when writing a state is add the `@BelongsToContract` annotation. This annotation establishes the relationship between a state and a contract. Without this, your state does not know which contract is used to verify it.

1. Add the `MarsVoucherContract.class`.

2. Add the annotation `@BelongsToContract` to your state.

{{< note >}}
As you are writing the state, you will notice that IntelliJ prompts you to add imports that correspond to elements you've added. In this case, `@BelongsToContract` and `MarsVoucherContract` are underlined by IntelliJ. Click the underlined item and press **Enter** to add the relevant import. Repeat this process for all suggested imports.
{{< /note >}}

This is what your code should look like so far:

```kotlin
package net.corda.missionMars.states

import net.corda.missionMars.contracts.MarsVoucherContract
import net.corda.v5.ledger.contracts.BelongsToContract

@BelongsToContract(MarsVoucherContract.class)
class MarsVoucher {
}
```

{{< note >}}
Adding this annotation triggers an error in IntelliJ because you haven't created the `MarsVoucherContract` yet. Ignore this error for now - you will add the contract class in the [Write contracts](c5-basic-cordapp-contract.md) tutorial.
{{< /note >}}

When naming your CorDapp files, it's best practice to match your contract and state names. In this case the state is called `MarsVoucher`, so the contract is called `MarsVoucherContract`. Follow this naming convention when you write an original CorDapp to avoid confusion.

### Implement the state

The next step of implementing the state is to complete the class declaration by adding the <a href="../../../../../platform/corda/4.8/open-source/api-states.html#contractstate">`ContractState`</a>. This step ensures that Corda recognizes the `MarsVoucher` as a state.

In this case, use a `LinearState` to tie the `MarsVoucher` to a `LinearID`. You will also need to add a `@ConstructorForDeserialization` and a `JsonRepresentable`. You will add the details to this `JsonRepresentable` [later](#add-the-json-representable-data-class).

1. Add the public class `MarsVoucher` implementing a `LinearState`.
2. Add the `@ConstructorForDeserialization`.
3. Add the empty `JsonRepresentable`.

This is what your code should look like now:

```kotlin
package net.corda.missionMars.states

import com.google.gson.Gson
import net.corda.missionMars.contracts.MarsVoucherContract
import net.corda.v5.application.utilities.JsonRepresentable
import net.corda.v5.ledger.UniqueIdentifier
import net.corda.v5.ledger.contracts.BelongsToContract
import net.corda.v5.ledger.contracts.LinearState

@BelongsToContract(MarsVoucherContract::class)
data class MarsVoucher @ConstructorForDeserialization constructor (
) : LinearState, JsonRepresentable{

}
```

### Add constructor parameters and `participants`

Next, add these constructor parameters:

* `voucherDesc` - voucher description.
* `issuer` - the issuer of the voucher.
* `holder` - the current owner of the voucher.

In the class, you need to implement a method to populate the `participants` list of the state. This indicates the participant who will store the state.  

After adding these features, your code should look like this:

```kotlin
package net.corda.missionMars.states

import com.google.gson.Gson
import net.corda.missionMars.contracts.MarsVoucherContract
import net.corda.v5.application.identity.AbstractParty
import net.corda.v5.application.identity.Party
import net.corda.v5.application.utilities.JsonRepresentable
import net.corda.v5.ledger.UniqueIdentifier
import net.corda.v5.ledger.contracts.BelongsToContract
import net.corda.v5.ledger.contracts.LinearState

@BelongsToContract(MarsVoucherContract::class)
data class MarsVoucher @ConstructorForDeserialization constructor (
        val voucherDesc : String,//For example: "One voucher can be exchanged for one ticket to Mars"
        val issuer: Party, //The party who issued the voucher
        val holder: Party, //The party who currently owns the voucher
        override val linearId: UniqueIdentifier,//LinearState required variable
) : LinearState, JsonRepresentable{

  override val participants: List<AbstractParty> get() = listOf<AbstractParty>(issuer,holder)

}
```

### Add the JSON representable data class

Place the private variables you just defined in a JSON representable data class outside of the `MarsVoucher` class. This sets up a template that the node uses to send this data class to the RPC client.

After you've added this data class, your code should look like this:

```kotlin
package net.corda.missionMars.states

import com.google.gson.Gson
import net.corda.missionMars.contracts.MarsVoucherContract
import net.corda.v5.application.identity.AbstractParty
import net.corda.v5.application.identity.Party
import net.corda.v5.application.utilities.JsonRepresentable
import net.corda.v5.ledger.UniqueIdentifier
import net.corda.v5.ledger.contracts.BelongsToContract
import net.corda.v5.ledger.contracts.LinearState

@BelongsToContract(MarsVoucherContract::class)
data class MarsVoucher @ConstructorForDeserialization constructor (
        val voucherDesc : String,//For example: "One voucher can be exchanged for one ticket to Mars"
        val issuer: Party, //The party who issued the voucher
        val holder: Party, //The party who currently owns the voucher
        override val linearId: UniqueIdentifier,//LinearState required variable
) : LinearState, JsonRepresentable{

}

data class MarsVoucherDto(
        val voucherDesc : String,//For example: "One voucher can be exchanged for one ticket to Mars"
        val issuer: String, //The party who issued the voucher
        val holder: String, //The party who currently owns the voucher
        val linearId: String,//LinearState required variable
)
```

### Add the JSON representable

As noted in the [introduction](c5-basic-cordapp-intro.md), you must pass JSON parameters if you want the output to be returned over RPC. All of your CorDapp's external interactions are now performed via HTTP-RPC REST APIs. The node will return information in the same way.

You must add these parameters in the form of a `JsonRepresentable` with these components:

* A required method that is annotated with `@OverRide`. This is what the node will return each time the node is asked for a JSON representation of the state.
* A `Dto` class that will be used as the template of the returned JSON file. This class marks all variable types as `String`.
* A helper method that populates the template with the actual variables of the class.

1. Add the JSON representable with your variables. All of your variables must be strings.

2. Add the helper method that fills out the template for the node. The output contains all private variables in string format and their associated data.

After you've added these items, your code should look like this:

```kotlin
package net.corda.missionMars.states

import com.google.gson.Gson
import net.corda.missionMars.contracts.MarsVoucherContract
import net.corda.v5.application.identity.AbstractParty
import net.corda.v5.application.identity.Party
import net.corda.v5.application.utilities.JsonRepresentable
import net.corda.v5.ledger.UniqueIdentifier
import net.corda.v5.ledger.contracts.BelongsToContract
import net.corda.v5.ledger.contracts.LinearState

@BelongsToContract(MarsVoucherContract::class)
data class MarsVoucher @ConstructorForDeserialization constructor (
        val voucherDesc : String,//For example: "One voucher can be exchanged for one ticket to Mars"
        val issuer: Party, //The party who issued the voucher
        val holder: Party, //The party who currently owns the voucher
        override val linearId: UniqueIdentifier,//LinearState required variable
) : LinearState, JsonRepresentable{

    override val participants: List<AbstractParty> get() = listOf<AbstractParty>(issuer,holder)

    fun toDto(): MarsVoucherDto {
        return MarsVoucherDto(
                voucherDesc,
                issuer.name.toString(),
                holder.name.toString(),
                linearId.toString()
        )
    }

    override fun toJsonString(): String {
        return Gson().toJson(this.toDto())
    }
}

data class MarsVoucherDto(
      val voucherDesc : String,//For example: "One voucher can be exchanged for one ticket to Mars"
      val issuer: String, //The party who issued the voucher
      val holder: String, //The party who currently owns the voucher
      val linearId: String,//LinearState required variable
)
```

## Create the `BoardingTicket` state

The `BoardingTicket` state is the ticket that Mars Express self-issues to give to Peter. Now that you've written your first state, try writing the `BoardingTicket` state using this information.

Private variables:
* `description` - Trip information. Use type `String`.
* `marsExpress` - The space travel company issuing the ticket. Use type `Party`.
* `owner` - The party exchanging the ticket for the voucher. Use type `Party`.
* `daysUntilLaunch` - The number of days until the launch date. Use type `int`.

The `BoardingTicket` state is involved in two transactions. In the first transaction, Mars Express self-issues the `BoardingTicket`. The `marsExpress` party then fills both the `owner` and `marsExpress` fields of the transaction.

In the second transaction, an ownership transfer occurs. This means you must implement a helper method to perform the change of ownership.

### Check your work

After you have written the `BoardingTicket` state, your code should look like this:

```kotlin
package net.corda.missionMars.states

import com.google.gson.Gson
import net.corda.missionMars.contracts.BoardingTicketContract
import net.corda.v5.application.identity.AbstractParty
import net.corda.v5.application.identity.Party
import net.corda.v5.application.utilities.JsonRepresentable
import net.corda.v5.ledger.contracts.BelongsToContract
import net.corda.v5.ledger.contracts.ContractState
import java.util.*

@BelongsToContract(BoardingTicketContract::class)
data class BoardingTicket(
        var description : String, //Trip information
        var marsExpress : Party, //Party selling the ticket
        var owner: Party, //The party who exchanges the ticket for the voucher
        var daysUntilLaunch: Int)
    : ContractState, JsonRepresentable {

    //Secondary Constructor
    constructor(description: String, marsExpress: Party, daysUntilLaunch: Int) : this(
            description = description,
            marsExpress = marsExpress,
            owner = marsExpress,
            daysUntilLaunch = daysUntilLaunch
    )

    fun changeOwner(buyer: Party): BoardingTicket {
        return BoardingTicket(description, marsExpress, buyer, daysUntilLaunch)
    }

    override val participants: List<AbstractParty> get() = listOf<AbstractParty>(spaceCompany,owner)

    fun toDto(): BoardingTicketDto {
        return BoardingTicketDto(
                description,
                marsExpress.name.toString(),
                owner.name.toString(),
                daysUntilLaunch.toString()
        )
    }

    override fun toJsonString(): String {
        return Gson().toJson(this.toDto())
    }
}

data class BoardingTicketDto(
        var description : String, //Brand or type
        var marsExpress : String, //Origin of the ticket
        var owner: String, //The party who exchanges the ticket for the voucher.
        var daysUntilLaunch: String
)
```
