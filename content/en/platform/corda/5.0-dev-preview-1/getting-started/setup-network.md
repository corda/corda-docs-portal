In this document, you will learn how to set up a local Corda 5 development network using Docker. You can then use this network to perform manual and/or automated testing.

Use this procedure if you are developing a CorDapp but not deploying it to a production environment.

{{< note >}}

In the Corda 5 Developer Preview release, the notaries support non-validating mode only. Validating mode is not supported.

## Before you start

Before you begin, make sure you [set up your development environment first](setup-environment.md).


## Configure your network

Configure your network by running the following Corda CLI command:

`corda-cli network config <network-type> <network-name>`

Where:
* `network-type` is the type of the network - currently only `docker-compose` is supported.
* `network-name` is the name of the network.

For example, to configure the `smoke-tests-network`, use:

`corda-cli network config docker-compose smoke-tests-network`

**Step result:** The `smoke-tests-network` has been configured for Docker Compose, and is ready to be deployed.


## Create network definitions file

1. Create a network definition `<network-name>.yaml` file in the root of your project.

   The network definition `.yaml` file is a template for the network you want to deploy. This template allows you to configure how the nodes will be set up.

2. Add parameters to your newly-created `<network-name>.yaml` file.

   This is an example of a `.yaml` file with its parameters:

```
# Nodes in network
nodes:
  # Name of the node
  alice:
    # (Optional) Specify the X500 name of the node
    x500: "O=Borrower, C=GB, L=LONDON, CN=blah-Inc"
    # (Optional) Specify the database type: "postgres:13" or "H2" (default)
    database: "postgres:13"
    # (Optional) Enable remote debugging of the Corda node
    debug: true
    # (Optional) Specify users and permissions
    users:
      fred:
        password: mySecretPassword
        permissions: ["ALL"]
      alfred:
        password: alfredPassword
  bob:
  caroline:
    # (Optional) Indicate if the node is a notary
    notary: true
```


## Deploy your network

1. Deploy your network by running one of the following commands:

   * If you are in the same directory as your `<network-name>.yaml` file, run:

   `corda-cli network deploy -n <network-name> | docker-compose -f - up -d`

   * If you are not in the directory of your `<network-name>.yaml` file, run:

   `corda-cli network deploy -n <network-name> -f <network-name.yaml file location> | docker-compose -f - up -d`

   The `corda-cli network deploy` command will look for the type of network and a network definition file (by default in the local directory) with the name `<network-name>.yaml`. It will output a `.yaml` file to stdout that Docker Compose can use to create your local test network.

   {{< note >}}

   When using the docker-compose `up` command, it's recommended to use it in detached mode (`-d`).

   {{< /note >}}

2. Wait for the nodes to run. You can monitor nodes starting up by running this command:

   `corda-cli network wait -n <network-name>`

   This command inspects the logs every few seconds until all the nodes are ready.

   {{< note >}}

   During network deployment, the nodes' keys, key stores, and certificates are generated automatically.

   {{< /note >}}


3. To monitor logs, run this Corda CLI command:

   `corda-cli network deploy -n <network-name> | docker-compose -f - logs -f`

    The terminal displays the standard output of all the nodes in the network. Once a network is running, it shows a message similar to: `Running P2PMessaging loop`. You must wait for all the nodes to run. When all nodes have run, an output similar to the output shown below will appear.
