Corda Services are classes that provide methods to both flows and other Corda Services. Each service and method allows flows and Corda Services to perform specific functions.

In technical terms, a Corda Service is any class that needs to be a long-lived singleton that can be injected into flows and other services via the `@CordaInject` dependency injection mechanism. You can use them to create classes external to flows where you can logically group code that isn't directly related to the execution of a flow.

For example:

**Kotlin:**
```kotlin
@CordaInject
lateinit var transactionService: TransactionService
```
**Java:**
```Java
@CordaInject
TransactionService transactionService;
```

This injection is intended for use within custom CorDapp classes instantiated by Corda using reflection. This is currently limited to CorDapp flows, custom Corda Services, and notary services.

For a complete overview of each Corda Service and its methods, use the [Corda 5 Developer Preview list of injectable services](injectable-services.md).

{{< note >}}
The best way to learn how to use Corda Services in the Corda 5 Developer Preview, is to follow the tutorial for [Building your first CorDapp](/en/platform/corda/5.0-dev-preview-1/tutorials/building-cordapp/c5-basic-cordapp-intro.html).

## Make a service injectable

In order to make a service injectable, it must first implement one or both of the injection interfaces:
* `CordaFlowInjectable`
* `CordaServiceInjectable`

These are empty interface used to indicate that a service can be injected, and where it can be injected. Implementing `CordaFlowInjectable` will allow for injection into a Flow, and `CordaServiceInjectable` will allow for injection in a Corda service or notary service.

## Basics of injecting a Corda Service

To inject Corda Services, define a field annotated with the `@CordaInject` annotation. The system will set the field before the `call` method is called.

{{< note >}}
You cannot use the injected services before the `call` method has been called as they will not be available to the constructor.

## Flow examples

In the following examples you will learn how to inject a Corda Service into other Corda Services and Flows.

### Java example

The Corda Service interfaces `FooService` and `BarService` are defined.
```java
interface FooService extends CordaService, CordaFlowInjectable, CordaServiceInjectable {
    Boolean canFoo();
}

interface BarService extends CordaService, CordaFlowInjectable, CordaServiceInjectable {
    String getFooBar();
}
```
`FooService` is implemented.
```java
class FooServiceImpl implements FooService {
    @Override
    public Boolean canFoo() {
        return true;
    }
}
```
`BarService` is implemented. Notice that `BarServiceImpl` injects `FooService` and invokes `canFoo()` in the `getFooBar()` function.
```java
class BarServiceImpl implements BarService {
    @CordaInject
    private FooService fooService;

    @Override
    public String getFooBar() {
        if(fooService.canFoo()) {
            return "foobar";
        } else {
            return "bar";
        }
    }
}
```
Here is a flow which injects the `BarService` and calls `getFooBar()`, which in turn invokes `fooService.canFoo()`.
```java
@StartableByRPC
class FooBarFlow implements Flow<String> {

    @JsonConstructor
    public FooBarFlow(RpcStartFlowRequestParameters params) { }

    @CordaInject
    private BarService barService;

    @Override
    public String call() {
        return barService.getFooBar();
    }
}
```

### Kotlin example

The Corda Service interfaces `FooService` and `BarService` are defined.
```kotlin
interface FooService : CordaService, CordaFlowInjectable, CordaServiceInjectable {
    fun canFoo(): Boolean
}

interface BarService : CordaService, CordaFlowInjectable, CordaServiceInjectable {
    fun getFooBar(): String
}
```
`FooService` is implemented.
```kotlin
class FooServiceImpl : FooService {
    override fun canFoo(): Boolean {
        return true
    }
}
```
`BarService` is implemented. Notice that `BarServiceImpl` injects `FooService` and invokes `canFoo()` in the `getFooBar()` function.
```kotlin
class BarServiceImpl : BarService {
    @CordaInject
    private lateinit var fooService: FooService

    override fun getFooBar(): String {
        return if(fooService.canFoo()) {
            "foobar"
        } else {
            "bar"
        }
    }
}
```
Here is a flow which injects the `BarService` and calls `getFooBar()`, which in turn invokes `fooService.canFoo()`.
```kotlin
@StartableByRPC
class FooBarFlow @JsonConstructor constructor(val params: RpcStartFlowRequestParameters) : Flow<String> {

    @CordaInject
    private lateinit var barService: BarService

    override fun call(): String {
        return barService.getFooBar()
    }
}
```
