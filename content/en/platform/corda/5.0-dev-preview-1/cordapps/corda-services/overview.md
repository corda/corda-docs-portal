Corda Services are classes that provide methods to both Flows and other Corda Services. Each service and method allow flows and Corda Services to perform specific functions. Use these guides to discover key Corda Services, and the process of injecting those services into flows and other Corda Services.

For a complete overview of each Corda Service, and its methods, use the [Corda 5 Developer Preview API reference](../api/corda-5-dev-preview.html).
