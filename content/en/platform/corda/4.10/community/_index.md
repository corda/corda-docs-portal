## What's new in Corda Community Edition

Along with the free-to-use Corda platform, Corda Community Edition comes with an affordable support package from R3, the makers of Corda. Check the [Community Edition support services](http://r3.com/support) to see which flexible package suits you best.

## Set up Corda Community Edition in three steps

To start using Corda Community Edition if you have never used Corda before:

1. Install the required software:
   * Java 8 JDK
   * IntelliJ IDEA
   * Git
   * Gradle

For help finding these, use the [setup guide](community/getting-set-up.md).

2. Clone the CorDapp samples repository. CorDapps are applications that run on a Corda network. Run the appropriate command:

  * Java: `git clone http://github.com/corda/samples-java`
  * Kotlin: `git clone http://github.com/corda/samples-kotlin`

3. Follow the [tutorials](community/tutorial-cordapp.md) to set up a Corda network and start coding your CorDapps.

## Upgrade to Corda Community Edition from Corda Open Source

If you are already using an open source version of Corda (Corda 4.1â€“Corda 4.9) and want to upgrade to Corda Community Edition, you can choose to:

* Download the `.tar` [file](https://download.corda.net/corda-community-edition/4.10/community-4.10.tar).
