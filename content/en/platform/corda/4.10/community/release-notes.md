# Corda Community Edition 4.10 release notes

## Corda Community Edition 4.10.2 release notes

Corda Community Edition 4.10.2 is a patch release of Corda Community Edition focused on resolving issues.

### Fixed issues

* Updated documentation for both .startNodes() and .stopNodes() of MockNetwork to indicate that restarting nodes is not supported.

* Previously, the attachment class loader was being closed too early if it is evicted from the cache. Now, closing of attachment class loaders is delayed until all SerializationContext that refer to them (from BasicVerifier) have gone out of scope.

* Flow draining mode no longer acknowledges P2P in-flight messages that have not yet been committed to the database. Previously, flow draining mode acknowledged all in-flight messages as duplicate.

* Previously, a memory leak in the transaction cache occurred due to the weight of in-flight entries being undervalued. Improvements have been made to prevent in-flight entry weights from being undervalued and because they are now estimated more correctly, this results in a large decrease in the total size of cached entities.
  
* A fix for cache eviction has been applied where an issue resulted in an incorrect contract verification status while a database transaction was in progress during contract verification.

* Corda provides the NodeDriver to help developers write integration tests. Using the NodeDriver, developers can bring up nodes locally to run flows and inspect state updates. Previously, there was an issue with build pipelines with tests failing, as on some occasions, notaries took more than one minute (the default timeout value) to start.

  To resolve this, the NodeDriver now has a new parameter, `notaryHandleTimeout`. This parameter specifies how long to wait (in minutes) for a notary handle to come back after the notary has been started

* When a notary worker is shut down, message ID cleanup is now performed as the last shutdown activity, rather than the first; this prevents a situation where the notary worker might still appear to be part of the notary cluster and receiving client traffic while shutting down. 
  
* Previously, where nodes had invoked a very large number of flows, the cache of client IDs that had not been removed were taking up significant heap space. A solution has been implemented where the space taken up has been reduced by 170 bytes per entry. For example, 1 million unremoved client IDs now take up 170,000,000 bytes less heap space than before.

* A new or restarted peer node coming online and connecting to a node for the first time can significantly slow message processing from other peers on the node it connects to.  Now new peers coming online get a dedicated thread on the node they connect to and do not delay message processing for existing peer-to-peer connections on the receiving node.

* The default SSL handshake timeout for inbound connections has been increased to 60 seconds. If during SSL handshake, certificate revocation lists (CRLs) take a long time to download, or are unreachable, then this 60 seconds gives the node enough time to establish the connection if crlCheckSoftFail is enabled.

* Previously, when loading checkpoints, the only log messages recorded were at the end of the process, recording the total number of checkpoints loaded. 

  Now, the following additional logging has been added:

  * Checkpoints: Logging has been added for the two types of checkpoints—runnable and paused flows—being loaded; log messages show the number of checkpoints loaded every 30 seconds until all checkpoints have been loaded.

  * Finished flows: Log messages now show the number of finished flows.

  For example:

  ```
  [INFO ] 2023-02-03T17:00:12,767Z [main] statemachine.MultiThreadedStateMachineManager. - Loading checkPoints flows {}
  [INFO ] 2023-02-03T17:00:12,903Z [main] statemachine.MultiThreadedStateMachineManager. - Number of runnable flows: 0. Number of paused flows: 0 {}
  [INFO ] 2023-02-03T17:00:12,911Z [main] statemachine.MultiThreadedStateMachineManager. - Started loading finished flows {}
  [INFO ] 2023-02-03T17:00:28,437Z [main] statemachine.MultiThreadedStateMachineManager. - Loaded 9001 finished flows {}
  [INFO ] 2023-02-03T17:00:43,606Z [main] statemachine.MultiThreadedStateMachineManager. - Loaded 24001 finished flows {}
  [INFO ] 2023-02-03T17:00:46,650Z [main] statemachine.MultiThreadedStateMachineManager. - Number of finished flows : 27485 {}
  ```

* The certificate revocation checking has been improved with the introduction of a read timeout on the download of the certificate revocation lists (CRLs). The default CRL connect timeout has also been adjusted to better suit Corda nodes. The caching of CRLs has been increased from 30 seconds to 5 minutes.

## Corda Community Edition 4.10 release notes

Corda Community Edition 4.10 includes several new features, enhancements, and fixes.

## Platform version change

Corda 4.10 uses platform version 12.

For more information about platform versions, see [Versioning](versioning.md).

## New features and enhancements

### New service lifecycle event

During startup, a node publishes a new service lifecycle event BEFORE_STATE_MACHINE_START immediately prior to starting the state machine. The node does not start the state machine until all recipients of the event have handled it.

### Quick RPC for node health check

Some RPCs provided by the node are now “quick” in that they bypass the standard RPC thread pool and return relatively quickly even if the node is busy servicing a backlog of RPC requests. The affected RPCs are `currentNodeTime()` and `getProtocolVersion()`.

### Peer nodes not permanently blocked

Previously, if a node failed to open an AMQP connection to a peer node because there was a failure due to a problem with the TLS handshake, it was possible for the peer to be permanently blocked such that further connection attempts would not be attempted unless the node was restarted. With this update, peer nodes are now not permanently blocked but connections are retried using longer intervals - 5x 5 minutes, and then once a day.

### Node status published via JMX

A node now publishes a status via JMX - net.corda.Node.Status - that indicates what it is currently doing. The status is only available if the node is configured to publish information/metrics via JMX.

### Postgres support

Postgres 13.8 is now supported.

### Flows can now generate OpenTelemetry spans

The OpenTelemetry tracing signal is now supported in flows across nodes. For more information, see [OpenTelemetry](opentelemetry.md).

### Improved node diagnostics

This release includes improved node diagnostics:
* There is a thread dump to the log file every five minutes.
* There is a periodic check to determine if the state machine thread pool is blocked and a warning is generated if so.
* Log messages are now output, both on the nodes initiating flows on other flows and also on the receiving nodes. This ties outgoing initiate sessions to their message ID and also inbound initiate sessions to their message ID. This enables easier diagnosis of logs across nodes.

## Fixed issues

This release includes the following fixes:

* Warning messages from Artemis are no longer written to the standard output when disconnecting an SSH client from the node. However, the warnings are still written to the node’s log file.

* Corda node memory usage has been improved when using the tokens SDK with inMemory token selection enabled.

* Corda can fetch users' credentials and permissions from an external data source (for example, from a remote RDBMS). Credentials of this database are configured in the file `node.conf`. Previously, when a node was run,  Corda logged the password of this database to the log file. This issue has been resolved and the password is no longer written to the log file.

* Previously, a memory leak in the transaction cache occurred due to the weight of in-flight entries being undervalued. Improvements have been made to prevent in-flight entry weights from being undervalued and, because they are now estimated more correctly, this results in a large decrease in the total size of cached entities.

* Flow draining mode no longer acknowledges P2P in-flight messages that have not yet been committed to the database. Previously, flow draining mode acknowledged all in-flight messages as duplicate.

* Previously, the attachment class loader was being closed too early if it was evicted from the cache. Now, closing of attachment class loaders is delayed until all SerializationContext that refer to them (from BasicVerifier) have gone out of scope.
 
* Occasionally, database transactions were rolled back under heavy load that caused flow state machine threads to stop processing flows. This resulted in eventual node lockup in certain circumstances.
