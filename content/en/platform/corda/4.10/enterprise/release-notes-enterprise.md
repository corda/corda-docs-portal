# Corda Enterprise Edition 4.10 release notes

Corda Enterprise Edition 4.10 includes several new features, enhancements, and fixes.

## Platform version change

Corda 4.10 uses platform version 12.

For more information about platform versions, see [Versioning](cordapps/versioning.md).

## New features and enhancements

### New service lifecycle event

During startup, a node publishes a new service lifecycle event BEFORE_STATE_MACHINE_START immediately prior to starting the state machine. The node does not start the state machine until all recipients of the event have handled it.

### Quick RPC for node health check

Some RPCs provided by the node are now “quick” in that they bypass the standard RPC thread pool and return relatively quickly even if the node is busy servicing a backlog of RPC requests. The affected RPCs are currentNodeTime() and getProtocolVersion().

### Peer nodes not permanently blocked

Previously, if a node failed to open an AMQP connection to a peer node because there was a failure due to a problem with the TLS handshake, it was possible for the peer to be permanently blocked such that further connection attempts would not be attempted unless the node was restarted. With this update, peer nodes are now not permanently blocked but connections are retried using longer intervals - 5x 5 minutes, and then once a day.

### New crypto service configuration option introduced

A new node configuration option, `cryptoServiceFlowRetryCount`, has been introduced.

Previously, flows that suffered a `CryptoServiceException` were admitted to the flow hospital for processing. The flow was retried a maximum of two times, and if it still failed then the exception was propagated back to the code that invoked the flow and the flow was failed.

Now, *cryptoServiceFlowRetryCount* can be used to override the above default actions for when a CryptoServiceException exception has been thrown due to a timeout with the crypto service. Other causes of `CryptoServiceException` are unaffected by this update.

The *absolute value* of *cryptoServiceFlowRetryCount* determines the number of times a flow is retried. The *sign* of the value determines what happens when all retries are exhausted:

* If a *negative* value is specified, then a CryptoServiceException is propagated back to the calling code and the flow fails; this was the default behaviour in versions of Corda before 4.10.
* If a *positive* value is specified, then the flow is held in the flow hospital for overnight observation so that a node operator can review it.

### Node status published via JMX

A node now publishes a status via JMX - net.corda.Node.Status - that indicates what it is currently doing. The status is only available if the node is configured to publish information/metrics via JMX.

### Java serialization disabled in the firewall

Java serialization is now disabled in the Corda firewall component, as a mitigation against attack should access be obtained maliciously to perform remote code execution.

### Postgres support

Postgres 13.8 is now supported.

### Flows can now generate OpenTelemetry spans

The OpenTelemetry tracing signal is now supported in flows across nodes. For more information, see [OpenTelemetry](node/operating/monitoring-and-logging/opentelemetry.md).

### Improved node diagnostics

This release includes improved node diagnostics:

* There is a thread dump to the log file every five minutes.
* There is a periodic check to determine if the state machine thread pool is blocked and a warning is generated if so.
* Log messages are now output, both on the nodes initiating flows on other flows and also on the receiving nodes. This ties outgoing initiate sessions to their message ID and also inbound initiate sessions to their message ID. This enables easier diagnosis of logs across nodes.

## Fixed issues

This release includes the following fixes:

* Warning messages from Artemis are no longer written to the standard output when disconnecting an SSH client from the node. However, the warnings are still written to the node’s log file.

* Corda node memory usage has been improved when using the tokens SDK with inMemory token selection enabled.

* Corda can fetch users' credentials and permissions from an external data source (for example, from a remote RDBMS). Credentials of this database are configured in the file `node.conf`. Previously, when a node was run, Corda logged the password of this database to the log file. This issue has been resolved and the password is no longer written to the log file.

* Previously, Archive Service commands did not write messages to the log files unless an error or issue occurred. An update now means that messages are also written when commands are run successfully. For more information, refer to [Archive Service Command-Line Interface (CLI)]({{< relref "../../../../tools/archiving-service/archiving-cli.md" >}})

* Previously, a memory leak in the transaction cache occurred due to the weight of in-flight entries being undervalued. Improvements have been made to prevent in-flight entry weights from being undervalued and, because they are now estimated more correctly, this results in a large decrease in the total size of cached entities.

* Flow draining mode no longer acknowledges P2P in-flight messages that have not yet been committed to the database. Previously, flow draining mode acknowledged all in-flight messages as duplicate.

* Previously, the attachment class loader was being closed too early if it was evicted from the cache. Now, closing of attachment class loaders is delayed until all SerializationContext that refer to them (from BasicVerifier) have gone out of scope.
 
* Occasionally, database transactions were rolled back under heavy load that caused flow state machine threads to stop processing flows. This resulted in eventual node lockup in certain circumstances.

### Database schema changes

There are no database changes between 4.9 and 4.10.
