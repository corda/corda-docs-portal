As a CorDapp Developer,

I want to be able to write flows in a way that matches my conceptual understanding of what a flow is and how it should work.

I want to be able to write flows with the minimum amount of non-value add boiler plate code.

I want to be guided to write correct code (eg, code completion, standard templates).

I want to be prevented from making non-obvious mistakes such as missing required Annotations.

The APIs for the services I use in a Flow should be intuitive, easy to use and well documented

So that I can write flows quickly and efficiently with minimum frustration related to how the Flow should be constructed.
