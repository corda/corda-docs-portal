The focus of the Corda 5 Developer Preview 2 is enabling CorDapp Developers to write, compile, and run their first basic CorDapps for Corda 5.
In Developer Preview 2 you can deploy to the combined worker, as described in the [Getting Started section](../getting-started/running-your-first-cordapp/run-first-cordapp.html).
The deployment and operation of Corda 5 will be explored further in future releases.
In the meantime, you can experiment with multi-worker deployments by reading about the deployment of Corda to a Kubernetes cluster on the [corda-runtime-os wiki](https://github.com/corda/corda-runtime-os/wiki/Local-development-with-Kubernetes).
