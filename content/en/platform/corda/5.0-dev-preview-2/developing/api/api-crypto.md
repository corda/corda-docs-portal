The `corda-crypto` module is one of several modules of the `Corda Crypto API`. The module defines low-level artifacts, such as classes, which are used as method arguments and return values, exceptions, constants, and helper functions that are used by other parts of the Corda platform as well as CorDapps. The dependencies on the Corda Crypto API are shown in the diagram below.
