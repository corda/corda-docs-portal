## Introduction
Corda is a platform that enables you to build permissioned blockchain networks, create applications that solve a business problem that requires parties to come to some agreement, and interact in a completely secure ecosystem.
Corda 5 was designed with an understanding that it is the job of a platform job to serve those running software on it.

As a developer, Corda 5 is an accessible toolbox with well-defined layers for you to pull a solution together.
It does not force complexity or concepts but gives a streamlined iteration for the testing and development loop.
It is drivable by standard, restful APIs.

As an operator of a network, Corda 5 places the control in your hands, acknowledging that the rules governing access to a network are best set and managed by the operator. Deployment can match the scale of the problem and grow and adapt as that changes.
It is cloud-native, behaving as one would expect any modern application to with the tooling to match.

## Start Small
Corda 5 is designed to enable anyone to start small and scale as needed. An entire application network can run on a single laptop, with many self-sovereign identities sharing the compute resources. When required, Corda supports scaling out to the data center, allowing true decentralization of execution as identities progressively move to their own clusters. The network grows without losing control over what is important; the rules allowing people into the network and the rules governing the exchange of information. Whether running ten identities or many thousands, Corda 5 handles it.

## Highly Available
The worker architecture means Corda 5 can be deployed in a HH/AA configuration that ensures continuity of execution under fault scenarios. If a worker crashes, another can simply pick up the check-pointed flow and continue execution.
## Scale Out
That same architecture allows horizontal scaling to facilitate the parallel execution of thousands of flows, with capacity able to be added and removed as needed through the scaling of the worker community.

## No Work, No Cost
Identities are not tied to a single executing compute instance, when idle, aside from some small costs associated with static storage, identity doesnâ€™t incur overhead. This allows the interleaving of many identities on a much smaller system than previously available, dramatically reducing the cost per identity.

## Progressive Decentralisation
