Networks in Corda 5 are application networks, where all participants are running the same CorDapp. Network registration and member distribution is handled by the [Membership Group Manager (MGM)](../mgm/overview.html). Application networks embrace the reality that regulated markets have strong privacy and governance requirements, reducing the scope of each network to a single bundle of applications all governed by the same rules.
