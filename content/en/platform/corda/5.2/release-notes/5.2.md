# Corda {{< version-num >}} Release Notes

This page lists the key changes in the {{< version-num >}} release of Corda and contains the following:

* [Enhancements](#enhancements)
* [Fixed Issues](#fixed-issues)
* [Known Issues and Limitations](#known-issues-and-limitations)

For information about upgrading a Corda cluster from 5.1 to 5.2, see [Upgrading from 5.1]({{< relref "../deploying-operating/deployment/upgrading/_index.md" >}}).

## Enhancements

This section describes the enhancements made in {{< version-num >}}. These were made in the following areas:

* [Performance](#performance)
* [Deployment](#deployment)
* [Application Networks](#application-networks)
* [REST API](#rest-api)
* [Configuration](#configuration)
* [Security](#security)
* [CorDapp Development](#cordapp-development)

### Performance

The number of TPS (transactions per second) has been improved while maintaining low latency.

### Deployment

#### Database Configuration

All database connection details must now be configured once and referenced by `id` during deployment. It is now possible to specify which database is used for which state type and also configure finer-grained access control.

For more information, see [the PostgreSQL section]({{< relref "../deploying-operating/deployment/deploying/_index.md#postgresql" >}}) of the _Deployment_ section.

#### Bring Your Own Database

A bring-your-own-database (BYOD) feature has been introduced to enable Cluster Administrators to manage the creation and any subsequent updates of PostgreSQL databases for virtual nodes, rather than using a database managed by Corda.

For more information, see [Bringing Your Own Database]({{< relref "../deploying-operating/vnodes/bring-your-own-db.md" >}}).

#### Database Search Path

Database URLs can no longer specify the `search_path` parameter. If you manually create users, you must specify their `search_path` for their schema. For more information, see [Manual Database Bootstrapping]({{< relref "../deploying-operating/deployment/deploying/manual-bootstrapping.md" >}}) and [Bringing Your Own Database]({{< relref "../deploying-operating/vnodes/bring-your-own-db.md" >}}).

#### Istio Integration

It is now possible to integrate with Istio service mesh to secure communication between Corda workers.

For more information about configuring your deployment, see [Istio Integration]({{< relref "../deploying-operating/deployment/deploying/_index.md#istio-integration" >}}).

### Application Networks

#### Changing the MGM Endpoint and Re-registering the MGM

It is now possible to re-register an MGM to update the MGM's member-provided context; for example, after a platform upgrade, after changes to the MGM's endpoint information, or if a previous attempt by the MGM to register failed.

For more information, see [Re-register an MGM]({{< relref "../application-networks/creating/mgm/reregister.md" >}}).

### REST API

#### Flow Status

The `GET flow/{holdingIdentityShortHash}` endpoint has been updated to take a flow status as an optional parameter.
This enables you to filter the flows returned to those of a particular status.

For more information, see [the REST API Reference](../reference/rest-api/openapi.html#tag/Flow-Management-API/operation/get_flow__holdingidentityshorthash_).

#### RBAC User Password

It is now possible to change the password of RBAC users. The following new endpoints have been added:

* `/api/v5_2/user/{loginName}/selfpassword;`
* `/api/v5_2/user/{loginName}/otheruserpassword.`

For more information, see [the REST API Reference](../reference/rest-api/openapi.html#tag/RBAC-User-API).

### Configuration

#### P2P Session Heartbeat Messages

A new setting `heartbeatEnabled` has been added to the `corda.p2p.linkManager` configuration section to specify if session heartbeat messages are enabled. Disabling heartbeats can lead to lower message overhead for a cluster, particularly for clusters that host many virtual nodes that communicate with many other virtual nodes residing in different clusters. However, it can also lead to slower failover if link manager processes become unavailable. As a result, heartbeats are enabled by default.

For more information, see [corda.p2p.linkManager]({{< relref "../deploying-operating/config/fields/p2p-LinkManager.md" >}}).

#### Mediator Configuration

The following new settings have been added to the `corda.messaging` configuration section for the multi-source mediator:

* `subscription.mediator.pollTimeout`
* `subscription.mediator.poolSize`
* `subscription.mediator.minPoolRecordCount`

The mediator is the subscription used to process flows.

For more information see [corda.messaging]({{< relref "../deploying-operating/config/fields/messaging.md" >}}).

#### RBAC Password

A new setting `lengthLimit` has been added to the `corda.rbac` configuration section to specify the maximum number of characters of new passwords.

For more information, see [corda.rbac]({{< relref "../deploying-operating/config/fields/rbac.md" >}}).

### Security

#### Wrapping Key Rotation

It is now possible to rotate the following types of {{< tooltip >}}wrapping keys{{< /tooltip >}}:

* master
* virtual node
* `rest` and `crypto` cluster-level service wrapping keys

The following new REST API methods have been added:

* [POST method of the /api/v5_2/wrappingkey/rotation/{tenantid}](../reference/rest-api/openapi.html#tag/Key-Rotation-API/operation/post_wrappingkey_rotation__tenantid_)
* [GET method of the /api/v5_2/wrappingkey/rotation/{tenantid}](../reference/rest-api/openapi.html#tag/Key-Rotation-API/operation/get_wrappingkey_rotation__tenantid_)

For more information see, [Managing Wrapping Keys]({{< relref "../deploying-operating/keys/_index.md">}}).

### CorDapp Development

#### Corda Runtime Gradle Plugin

The CorDapp template, including the runtime Gradle plugin, (formerly known as the CSDE) is now compatible with Corda 5.2.

For more information, see [CorDapp Template]({{< relref "../developing-applications/cordapp-template/_index.md" >}}).

#### Transaction Privacy Enhancements

It is now possible to operate a network that increases the privacy of transactions by no longer requiring every virtual node in a network to see and verify all predecessors, linked by inputs, back to issuance of a transaction on the UTXO ledger. In exchange, visibility of transaction content must be given to the notary.

For more information, see [Transaction Privacy Enhancements]({{< relref "../developing-applications/ledger/enhanced-ledger-privacy.md" >}}).

#### Flow Session-Specific Timeout

The client can now specify a flow session-specific timeout on the Flow Message API. If the client does not provide a timeout value, Corda uses the value in the `corda.flow` configuration section, as in previous releases.

#### Web Socket

The web socket interface for retrieving flow status updates is no longer available.

#### Order By Vault-Named Queries

It is now possible to register vault-named queries with an `ORDER BY` clause. This clause can use the database columns and the JSON representation of the states.

#### Vault-Named Queries Null Parameters

It is now possible to specify null parameters in vault-named queries.

#### Send/Receive Transaction Flows

The following methods have been added to `UtxoLedgerService`:

* `sendTransaction` — sends a `UtxoSignedTransaction` transaction to counterparties.
* `receiveTransaction` — receives a verified transaction from a counterparty session and persists it to the vault.

For more information, see the [Javadocs](../../../../api-ref/corda/5.2/net/corda/v5/ledger/utxo/UtxoLedgerService.html).

## Fixed Issues

This section describes the issues resolved in {{< version-num >}}. These occurred in the following areas:

* [Deployment](#deployment)

### Deployment

#### Token Selection Sharding and Ingress

Enabling sharding for the token selection worker could interfere with Ingress enabled for the REST and P2P Gateway workers. This resulted in repeated updates to the status of the Ingress resources causing a loss in connectivity to the REST API or P2P Gateway.

## Known Issues and Limitations
