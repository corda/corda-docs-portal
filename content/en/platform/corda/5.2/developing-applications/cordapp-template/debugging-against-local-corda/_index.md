# Debugging Against Local Corda

The CorDapp template includes an IntelliJ run-time configuration that allows you to attach IntelliJâ€™s debugger to the local Corda cluster.
{{< note >}}
Currently there is a time-out issue when debugging Corda. As the local Corda cluster is a real Corda cluster, it behaves like one. Specifically, if the workers stop working, Corda detects it and errors out the flow. Unfortunately, it currently mistakes code held at a debugging point as a processor that has stopped working. As a result, although you can halt at a breakpoint and examine the stack, if you wait too long before resuming the execution of the code, it times out and the CorDapp does not continue to run as expected.
{{< /note >}}

To debug:

1. [Start the Corda combined worker using the startCorda Gradle helper]({{< relref  "../running-your-first-cordapp/_index.md#starting-the-corda-combined-worker" >}}), if not already started.
2. [Deploy your CorDapp using deployCordapp]({{< relref "../running-your-first-cordapp/_index.md#deploying-a-cordapp" >}}), if not already deployed.
3. Select the `DebugCorDapp` run configuration.

4. Click the **Debug** button.

   The following message is displayed to indicate a successful connection:

5. Place a breakpoint next to the place in the code you want to inspect.

6. Start a flow using the Swagger UI; see [Running your First CorDapp]({{< relref "../running-your-first-cordapp/_index.md" >}}).
   The CorDapp stops execution at the breakpoint and you can inspect the stack.

  As described previously, if you wait too long to resume, the flow will fail. The logs will contain one or more of the following messages:

   * `2022-09-20 18:43:20.278 [Thread-94] ERROR net.corda.flow.pipeline.impl.FlowEventPipelineImpl - Flow execution timeout, Flow marked as failed, interrupt attempted`
   * `java.util.concurrent.TimeoutException: null`
   * `net.corda.flow.pipeline.exceptions.FlowEventException: Received a Wakeup for flow [f9a83184-2f83-4587-aca4-e622f4b1bfee] that does not exist`
