# Corda Open Source Edition 4.12 release notes

## Corda Open Source Edition 4.12.1 release notes

Corda Community Edition 4.12.1 is a patch release of Corda Community Edition focused on resolving issues.

### Fixed issues

* `ReleaseFinalityFlow` was returning a transaction that was missing the notary signature. This has now been fixed. The returned transaction now includes the notary signature.

## Corda Open Source Edition 4.12 release notes

The Corda Open Source Edition 4.12 release introduces upgrades to the Java and Kotlin versions, along with associated upgrade support. Apart from the features supporting the Java and Kotlin upgrade, no other major new features have been introduced. In this release, Java has been upgraded to Java 17 from Java 8 and Kotlin has been upgraded to Kotlin 1.9.20 from 1.2.71.

When a CorDapp(s) and a node are successfully upgraded to 4.12, you are able to seamlessly interoperate 4.12 and 4.11 (or earlier) nodes on the same network, including the existing transactions on the ledger.

Supporting new Java and Kotlin versions is a major feature, as we must also handle legacy contracts from existing backchains. The upgraded Java and Kotlin versions also have implications for CorDapp developers. Simply replacing the Corda JAR without introducing other changes is not possible.

### Upgrade recommendation

As a developer or node operator, you should upgrade to the [latest released version of Corda]({{< relref "../community/_index.md" >}}) as soon as possible. The latest Corda Open Source release notes are on this page, and for the latest upgrade guide, refer to [Corda Open Source Edition 4.11 to 4.12 upgrade guide]({{< relref "comm-upgrade-guide.md" >}}).

The steps from this guide only work for direct upgrades from Corda 4.11 to 4.12. If you have any nodes on versions 4.10 and below, you must upgrade them to 4.11 first. To do that, consult the relevant release upgrade documentation.

### Platform version change

Corda 4.12 uses platform version 140.

For more information about platform versions, see [Versioning]({{< relref "versioning.md" >}}).

### New features, enhancements and restrictions

#### Java and Kotlin upgrade

Corda 4.12 requires Java 17 and Kotlin 1.9.20. This means that you must recompile any legacy CorDapps written for 4.11 or earlier to work with Java 17 and Kotlin 1.9.20 to be compatible with Corda 4.12. These upgrades enhance the supportability and security of Corda.

#### Java 17 compatible releases of Corda SDKs

The base Corda package includes several SDKs and libraries. These SDKs and libraries are compatible with Java 17 and Kotlin 1.9.20:

| SDK/library               | Java 17 compatible release    |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------|
| corda-shell               | 4.12                          |
| r3-libs                   | 1.4                           |
| confidential-identities   | 1.2                           |
| accounts                  | 1.1                           |
| token-sdk                 | 1.3                           |
| reissue-cordapp           | 1.1                           |
| archiving                 | 1.2                           |
| ledger-graph              | 1.3                           |
| r3-tools                  | 4.12                          |

#### Support for signature constraints only

Only CorDapps using signature constraints are supported in Corda 4.12; hash constraints are not supported. Using signature constraints has been recommended in previous releases of Corda as it eases the CorDapp upgrade process. If you have any 4.11 CorDapps using hash constraints, you must migrate them to signature constraints on 4.11 before upgrading to 4.12.

#### Corda 4.11 and 4.12 CorDapps must be signed by the same set of keys

Once you have recompiled your 4.12 CorDapps for Java 17 and Kotlin 1.9.20, you must sign them using the same set of keys used by the 4.11 CorDapp.

#### Explicit contract upgrade is not supported

Explicit contract upgrade is not supported in Corda 4.12.

#### `toLedgerTransaction.verify` does not work for legacy transactions

You must review your CorDapps and check for any making the following calls:
* `SignedTransaction.toLedgerTransaction().verify()`
* `WireTransaction.toLedgerTransaction().verify()`
* `TransactionBuilder.toLedgerTransaction().verify()`

CorDapps that make the above calls will not work for legacy transactions. To make those CorDapps compatible, change them to `SignedTransaction.verify()`.

#### Corda node explorer not supported on Java 17

The node explorer has not been converted to use Java 17 and is not provided in the release packs. If you wish to use a node explorer, the only current option is to use a 4.11 node explorer and use it to connect to a 4.12 node.

#### Samples Kotlin and Java support

The following two public repositories provide various CorDapp samples (branch: release/4.12):
* [Samples Kotlin repository](https://github.com/corda/samples-kotlin/tree/release/4.12)
* [Samples Java repository](https://github.com/corda/samples-java/tree/release/4.12)

Most samples have been converted over to Java 17, Kotlin 1.9.20, and Gradle 7.6.4.

The samples have been written to work with Corda Open Source. To convert a sample to work with Corda Enterprise, then at a minimum you need to point to a repository where your enterprise artifacts are installed. Also, the artifact group name for ENT (`com.r3`) must be different from OS `(net.corda`). For example, switch `net.corda:corda-node-driver:4.12` (Corda OS) to `com.r3.corda:corda-node-driver:4.12` (Corda ENT).

The following dependencies have been used in samples and can be switched from Corda OS to Corda Enterprise:
* corda
* corda-confidential-identities
* corda-core-test-utils
* corda-finance-workflows
* corda-jackson
* corda-node
* corda-node-api
* corda-node-driver
* corda-rpc
* corda-shell
* corda-test-utils
* corda-testserver-impl

The samples listed below have been converted to and tested with Java 17 and Kotlin 1.9.20:

#### Kotlin and Java CorDapp templates

The following Kotlin and Java CorDapp templates have been converted to Java 17, Kotlin 1.9.20, and Gradle 7.6.4. They have been written to work with Corda Open Source Edition (branch: release/4.12):
* [Kotlin CorDapp template](https://github.com/corda/cordapp-template-kotlin/tree/release/4.12)
* [Java CorDapp template](https://github.com/corda/cordapp-template-java/tree/release/4.12)

#### CorDapp using internal APIs or reflective access

If your CorDapp is using internal APIs or reflective access, then you may need to explicitly open the module on the command line. You can do this by adding one or more `â€“add-opens` options when starting Corda.

### Fixed issues

#### Thread.contextClassLoader set for resumed flow on node startup

Previously, if a flow was resuming on node startup, the thread context class loader was not set, potentially causing `ClassNotFound` issues for CorDapp classes. This has been fixed now.

### Known issues

#### Extra stack trace output when logging level is `TRACE`

If you start the node with log level set to trace via the command line option `--logging-level=TRACE`, then you will see some `Unable to format stack trace` outputs from Log4j caused by a bug in Artemis. These can be ignored and have no effect on node operation. They can be removed via a custom log4j.xml where trace output from the `org.apache.activemq.artemis.core.paging.cursor.impl.PageCursorProviderImpl` logger is removed.

#### Startup warnings from Log4j

At node startup with the default Log4j, the following message appears: `main WARN The use of package scanning to locate plugins is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.` This is a warning only and can be safely ignored. We are currently investigating alternatives.

#### Intermittent warning from Bouncy Castle when running `deployNodes`

When running the Gradle task `deployNodes`, you may occasionally see the following warning message:

```
exception in disposal thread: org/bouncycastle/util/dispose/DisposalDaemon$3
```

This is a warning message from the LTS version of Bouncy Castle we are currently using. There is no user impact and it is related to disposing of references with native code. This will be fixed in a future patch release.

### Third party component upgrades

The following table lists the dependency version changes between 4.11 and 4.12 Open Source Editions:
