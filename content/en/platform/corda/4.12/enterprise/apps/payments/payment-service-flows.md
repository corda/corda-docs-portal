Use Payment Service flows to initiate payments and account management requests from a node on a Corda network. These requests can then be picked up by the [Payments Agent]({{< relref "payments-agent.md" >}}) on your network.

Use the Payment Service flows to:

* Create a request for a payment to be made. [MakePayment](#makepayment).
* Reinstate a stalled payment into the payment workflow. [ReinstatePayment](#reinstatepayment).
* Cancel a stalled payment. [CancelPayment](#cancelpayment).
* Update and reinstate a stalled payment into the payment workflow. [RemediatePayment](#remediatepayment).
* Return the list of payments stalled on an error. [StalledPayments](#stalledpayments).
* Return the payment state associated with a specific payment ID or provided transaction reference. [PaymentById](#paymentbyid).
* Return the PSPs that are configured on the system and available to use. [AvailablePSPs](#availablepsps).
* Return a PSP specification from the Payments Agent. [PspSpecification](#pspspecification).
* Add a payment account for an existing account on the PSP. [AddPaymentAccount](#addpaymentaccount).
* Create a customer account for an existing customer on the PSP. [CreateCustomerAccount](#createcustomeraccount).
* Add a beneficiary account for an external customer. [AddBeneficiaryAccount](#addbeneficiaryaccount).
* Update payment account details. [UpdatePaymentAccount](#updatepaymentaccount).
* Update a beneficiary account details. [UpdateBeneficiaryAccount](#updatebeneficiaryaccount).
* Return a list of payment accounts held by the owning party. [PaymentAccounts](#paymentaccounts).
* Return the payment account associated with a payment account ID. [PaymentAccountId](#paymentaccountbyid).
* Return a list of transactions made against this account. [Transactions](#transactions)
* Return a list of payments made on the system by a given payment account. [Payments](#payments).
* Return the account balance for a given payment account ID. [AccountBalance](#accountbalance).
* Return the current default payments agent. [GetPaymentAgent](#getpaymentagent).

## `MakePayment`

Initiate a payment between participating nodes on the network.

### Parameters

* `amount`: Amount<`FiatCurrency`>. Required. The amount and currency of the payment to make. In the Corda Payments Technical Preview, you can use GBP or EUR.
* `debtor`: String. Required. A reference (signature) to debtor account (the account from which the payment is to be made—or the account from which `makePayment`is initiated) which is in turn resolved by the `AccountsResolver` service.
* `creditor`: String. Required. A reference (signature) to creditor account (the account into which the payment is to be made) which is in turn resolved by the `AccountsResolver` service.
* `transactionRef`: String. Provided reference to the specified transaction. Bound to the `externalId` of the generated `PaymentState`'s `UniqueIdentifier`. Should be unique.
* `externalId`: String. Corresponds to the ID provided by the PSP.

### Return type

`PaymentState` - The object containing information regarding the requested payment.
