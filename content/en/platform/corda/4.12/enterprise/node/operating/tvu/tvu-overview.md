# Transaction Validator Utility

Corda 4.12 has been released on and is compatible with JDK 17 and Kotlin 1.8. Therefore, upgrading to Corda 4.12 from a previous version of Corda means that you must update to a newer JDK and Kotlin version to align with the updated Corda dependencies.

If you are migrating to Corda 4.12 from an older version, you must ensure that the transactions committed to the database using the older Corda version are valid, verifiable, and deserializable post-migration. You can do this using the Transaction Validator Utility (TVU) which streams and performs validation on database transactions. TVU's useful features include:

* *Transaction validation:* Can validate (verify and deserialize) transactions by streaming them from the database. You can provide the database credentials as Hikari properties and they can also be read directly from a node using its `node.conf`.
* *Progress registration:* Registers its runtime progress with reference to the number of transactions processed.
* *Progress reloading:* Can be paused and resumed at a later point in time. This is particularly useful because the number of transactions can be high (possibly millions).
* *Transaction time loading:* Can start processing transactions from a supplied transaction time. This is particularly useful because the number of transactions can be high (possibly millions).
* *Reverification using transaction ID:* Can verify only certain transactions specified in a newline-separated transaction ID file. The utility only processes transactions with the transaction IDs in this file.
* *Error registration:* Can register any errors relating to transaction validation in a `.zip` file. This error `.zip` file stores erroneous transactionsâ€™ raw data.
* *Erroneous transaction re-verification:* Can re-validate the erroneous transactions specified in an error `.zip` file.
* *Transaction processor:* Can also act as a transaction processor, performing user-supplied tasks on each transaction. All the functionalities detailed in the previous points, that is, progress registration/reloading, error registration, and ID re-verification work for this mode as well.
