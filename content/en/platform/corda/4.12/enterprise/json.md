# JSON serialization

Corda provides a module that extends the popular Jackson serialization engine. Jackson can serialize
to and from JSON, and formats such as YAML and XML. Jackson is very modular - you can use
several plugins to extend its functionality. See the [Jackson home page](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson).

To gain support for JSON serialization of common Corda data types:

1. Include a dependency on `net.corda:jackson:XXX` in your Gradle or Maven build file, where XXX is the Corda version you are targeting (0.9 for M9, for instance).
2. Obtain a Jackson `ObjectMapper` instance configured using the `JacksonSupport.createNonRpcMapper()`
method.

You can use variations of this method to get alternative Jacksons configurations. For example, if you have an RPC
connection to the node (see [Interacting with the node]({{< relref "node/operating/clientrpc.md" >}})) then your JSON ObjectMapper can resolve identities found in objects. The `ObjectMapper` provides a straightforward, flexible way to parse and generate JSON response objects.

The way mappers interact with identity and RPC is likely to change in a future release.
