# Architecture for CorDapp Developers

This section describes Corda 5 from the perspective of a [CorDapp Developer]({{< relref "../../../../../about-the-docs/_index.md#cordapp-developer" >}}). Corda is an application host for {{< tooltip >}}CorDapps{{< /tooltip >}}. These are pieces of code, workflows, and contracts, executed on behalf of the members of an {{< tooltip >}}application network{{< /tooltip >}}, usually as part of an interaction or {{< tooltip >}}transaction{{< /tooltip >}} between peers on the network. CorDapp Developers are responsible for designing and writing this code.

A CorDapp is distributed because parts of the application can be, or may need to be, executed on a Corda instance that is operated by another party that is a member of the same Corda {{< tooltip >}}application network{{< /tooltip >}}.
This is not the same as an application that has multiple instances, hosted on different environments.

The following diagram shows a centralized application. This is a single application that always executes within a single execution environment, regardless of the number of deployments:

Similarly, centralized applications often use a services architecture, meaning different parts of the applications interact with each other. This could be inside an entity’s network, or different parts may be operated by different parties.

However, distributed applications in Corda, while being deployed by different parties in the network, are unique in that parts of the application execute in the different environments as part of the same execution context.

## Workflows, Contracts, and States

CorDapps are usually composed of workflows, contracts, and {{< tooltip >}}states{{< /tooltip >}}. This section illustrates that contracts and states are optional, but a CorDapp must always define at least one workflow, often referred to simply as a flow.

Flows support the [orchestration layer]({{< relref "../fundamentals/CorDapps/_index.md#orchestration-layer--flows" >}}), are written in a JVM compatible language, and are hosted by Corda. Typically, flows create or transfer states on behalf of a member of the application network (a {{< tooltip >}}virtual node{{< /tooltip >}}) who seeks to form [consensus]({{< relref "../fundamentals/CorDapps/_index.md#consensus-layer" >}}) with their peer nodes with the help of the {{< tooltip >}}notary{{< /tooltip >}}.

Taking the [IOU Sample App](https://github.com/corda/corda5-samples/blob/main/kotlin-samples/corda5-obligation-cordapp/) as an example of a distributed app, all members of this fictional network can be lenders or borrowers issuing, transferring, or settling loans directly to each other. There is no central ledger of loans, and consensus is achieved between the participating parties, not a central entity.

The sample app contains three flows:

* Issue
* Transfer
* Settle

Each flow handles an `IOUState` that represents the loan amount, lender, and borrower. `IOUContract` is a contract that verifies transactions that are part of the given flows, using the given state.
In this example, transactions are between borrower and lender, which means each party, members of the application network (virtual nodes), interact with each other to reach consensus.

## Participants and a Distributed Ledger

Corda flows usually involve multiple parties or participants, where each participant must be a member of the application network, or a virtual node, and is generally identified by an {{< tooltip >}}X.500{{< /tooltip >}} name.

In flow terms, the initiating flow is the code that is executed on the initiating participant, and the responder flow as the code that is executed as a response on the counter party (or parties). The initiating flow is generally initiated using the REST API, as described in the [Introducing the Corda APIs]({{< relref "./api/_index.md" >}}) section.

In the IOU example, the borrower and lender are both participants in the IOU issue flow, with the borrower on the initiating side and the lender on the responder side.

  figure
	 src="iou-app-flows.png"
   width="50%"
	 figcaption="IOU Application Flows"
>}}

When the flow shown in the diagram completes successfully, both participants have stored the state (`IOUState`) in their respective {{< tooltip >}}vault{{< /tooltip >}} databases.
In an example with multiple borrowers in the network, this could result in the following state:

{{<
  figure
	 src="iou-app-states.png"
   width="50%"
	 figcaption="IOU Application State"
>}}

As shown, the lender’s vault contains all loans, but borrowers Alice and Bob can only see the loans related to them.
This is referred to as a {{< tooltip >}}Distributed Ledger{{< /tooltip >}}. 

While flows usually involve multiple parties, they do not have to. Sometimes flows that only involve the initiating party are required. Examples of this are minting tokens or providing a read API for states already in the vault.

The IOU example records transactions in the vault. However, it is possible to create flows that do not use the vault, but only use the orchestration (flow) layer.
