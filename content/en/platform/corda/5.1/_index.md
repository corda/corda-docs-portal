# Next-Gen {{< version >}}

Corda is a platform that enables you to build permissioned networks, create applications that solve a business problem that requires parties to come to some agreement, and interact in a completely secure ecosystem. Corda 5 is the next-generation version, designed with an understanding that it is the job of a platform to serve those running software on it.

For Developers, Corda 5 is an accessible toolbox with well-defined layers that enables you to create solutions. It does not force complexity or concepts, but gives a streamlined iteration for the testing and development loop. It is supported by RESTful {{< tooltip >}}APIs{{< /tooltip >}}.

As an operator of a network, Corda 5 places the control in your hands, acknowledging that the rules governing access to a network are best set and managed by you. Deployments can match the scale of the problem and then grow and adapt as it changes. It is cloud-native; behaving as any other modern application, with the tooling to match.
