| Session Initiation | Used during end-to-end session handshakes between two clusters. This key also signs group parameters. <BR> A {{< tooltip >}}member{{< /tooltip >}} session initiation key signs the member's context of the `MemberInfo`. For more information, see [Configure Key Pairs and Certificates for the Member]({{< relref "../application-networks/creating/members/key-pairs.md#generate-a-session-initiation-key-pair" >}}). <BR>The {{< tooltip >}}MGM{{< /tooltip >}} session initiation key signs the MGM's context. For more information, see [Configure Key Pairs and Certificates for the MGM]({{< relref "../application-networks/creating/mgm/key-pairs.md#generate-a-session-initiation-key-pair" >}}). <BR>The session initiation key is also known as the identity key or session key.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | 256-bit ECDSA public/private authentication key pair |
| MGM Registration   | Encrypts/decrypts registration requests sent to the MGM by members. The {{< tooltip >}}Group policy{{< /tooltip >}} file includes the public MGM key for members to use when making registration requests. The MGM keeps the private key. Registration uses this key for authentication in the P2P protocol. The MGM registration key is also known as the Corda ECDH key. For more information, see [Configure Key Pairs and Certificates for the MGM]({{< relref "../application-networks/creating/mgm/key-pairs.md#generate-ecdh-key-pair">}}).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | 256-bit ECDSA private signature key pair             |
| Master Wrapping    | Decrypts, through wrapping keys, private keys. This master wrapping key is not available in the database but in higher trust zones (crypto worker and secret managers, for example) that enable decrypting database-encrypted wrapping keys. Encrypted wrapping keys can then decrypt the database-encrypted `VNodePrivateKey`. The crypto processor configuration specifies a set of master wrapping keys as SALT and passphrase parameters for key derivation. This produces a symmetric key which is used for wrapping (encrypting at rest) all corda managed wrapping keys. For more information, see [Key Wrapping]({{< relref "../key-concepts/cluster-admin/_index.md#key-wrapping">}}).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | AES-256 symmetric master key                         |
| Managed Wrapping   | Wraps higher level asymmetric private keys. These keys are stored, wrapped by a master wrapping key, in crypto databases in both the cluster and per virtual node. These are symmetric keys used to wrap higher level asymmetric private keys.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | AES-256 symmetric wrapping key                       |
| Ledger             | Signs flows and consumes Corda network ledger states. This key is critical for availability. The ledger key is also known as the virtual node private ledger signing key. For more information, see [Configure Key Pairs and Certificates for the Member]({{< relref "../application-networks/creating/members/key-pairs.md#generate-a-ledger-key-pair">}}).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | 256-bit ECDSA/EDDSA/RSA public/private signature key |
| Notary             | Each {{< tooltip >}}notary{{< /tooltip >}} virtual node has its own public/private key pair for signing successful notarization requests. A notary service (represented by multiple notary nodes) has a composite public key that is used to validate the signature of any notary node that represents that notary service. <BR> The MGM is responsible for maintaining the composite public key for the notary service as a whole, which it broadcasts as part of network information to members. The notary service does not have a public key of its own; instead, the MGM provides a composite public key of all active notary representatives. This allows a virtual node to verify that the approval of a notarization request was valid by ensuring that at least one notary representative of a notary service signed a notarization request. The notary key is also known as the notary signing key. For more information, see [Generate a Notary Key Pair]({{< relref "../application-networks/creating/notaries.md#generate-a-notary-key-pair">}}). | 256-bit ECDSA private signature key pair             |
| Ephemeral Session  | Authenticates and encrypts messages sent in one E2E session. Corda creates these secret symmetric keys during the SIGMA key exchange.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 256-bit AES symmetric authentication key           |
| Sensitive Config   | Decrypts sensitive values encrypted at rest (for example, in the database or Kafka). This key is derived from the `Sensitive config SALT and PASSPHRASE` [credential](#credentials).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | AES-256 symmetric data encryption key                |

## Infrastructure Keys
