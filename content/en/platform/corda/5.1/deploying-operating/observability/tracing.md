# Tracing Framework

As a Corda Cluster Operator, you may want to configure a tracing server and sample rate when deploying the {{< tooltip >}}Helm{{< /tooltip >}} chart.
The tracing configuration supported by the Helm chart contains the following configuration in the `values.yaml` file:

```yaml
tracing:
  # -- URL for the endpoint to send Zipkin-format distributed traces to for example http://tempo:9411
  endpoint: ""
  # --  Number of request traces to sample per second, defaults to 1 sample per second. Set to 'unlimited' to record all traces, but in this case the amount of tracing data produced can be quite vast.
  samplesPerSecond: "1"
```
