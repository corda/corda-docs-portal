# HTTP Requests

The REST server acts as a mediator, converting HTTP requests into messages that can be consumed by the Corda workers.
Two metrics offer insights into the HTTP requests: the cumulative count of requests received over a specific duration,
and the processing time for each request. There is a maximum time limit, or timeout, imposed on the processing of each
HTTP request. If a timeout is reached, an error message is dispatched to the HTTP client.
