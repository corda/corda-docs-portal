# Flow

Flow metrics measure the execution of flow classes provided by the {{< tooltip >}}CorDapp{{< /tooltip >}}, providing an indication of the performance and health of the flow engine Corda uses to execute these flows.

| Metric | Type | Tags | Description |
| :----------- | :----------- | :----------- | :----------- |
| `corda_flow_run_time_seconds` | Timer | <ul><li>`virtualnode`</li><li>`flow_class`</li><li>`status`</li></ul> | The time it took for a flow to complete successfully or to produce an error. |
| `corda_flow_fiber_serialization_time_seconds` | Timer | <ul><li>`flow_class`</li></ul> | The time it took to serialize a flow fiber. |
| `corda_flow_fiber_deserialization_time_seconds` | Timer | <ul><li>`flow_class`</li></ul> | The time it took to serialize a flow fiber. |
| `corda_flow_start_lag_seconds` | Timer | <ul><li>`flow_class`</li></ul> | The lag between flow start event, the REST API, and the flow processor. |
| `corda_flow_execution_time_seconds` | Timer | <ul><li>`flow_class`</li><li>`status`</li></ul> | The time it took to execute the flow (excluding any start lag). |
| `corda_flow_event_lag_seconds` | Timer | <ul><li>`flow_class`</li><li>`flow_event`</li></ul> | The lag between flow event publication and processing. |
| `corda_flow_event_pipeline_execution_time_seconds` | Timer | <ul><li>`flow_class`</li><li>`flow.event`</li></ul> | The time it took to execute the pipeline for given flows and flow event types. |
| `corda_flow_event_fiber_execution_time_seconds` | Timer | <ul><li>`flow_class`</li></ul> | The time it took to execute the fiber for a single suspension point. |
| `corda_flow_pipeline_execution_time_seconds` | Timer | <ul><li>`flow_class`</li></ul> | The total time that a flow spent processing in the pipeline, rather than queued (includes fiber execution time.) |
| `corda_flow_fiber_execution_time_seconds` | Timer | <ul><li>`flow_class`</li></ul> | The total time a flow spent executing user code in the fiber. |
| `corda_flow_suspension_wait_time_seconds` | Timer | <ul><li>`flow_class`</li></ul> | The time a flow spent waiting to awake from a suspension. |
| `corda_flow_event_suspension_wait_time_seconds` | Timer | <ul><li>`flow_class`</li><li>`flow_suspension_action`</li></ul> | The time a flow spent waiting to awake from a single suspension, broken down by action. |
| `corda_flow_scheduled_wakeup_count` | Counter | None | The number of times a scheduled wakeup is published for flows. |

Tags:
* `virtualnode`: The short hash of the {{< tooltip >}}virtual node{{< /tooltip >}} to which a metric applies.
* `flow_class`: The flow class for the metric.
* `status`: Indicates whether an operation succeeded or failed.
* `flow_event`: The type of event that was being processed for a given metric.
* `flow_suspension_action`: The action that triggered the flow to suspend.
