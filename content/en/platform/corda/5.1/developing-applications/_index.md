# Developing Applications

This section describes the tasks performed by {{< tooltip >}}CorDapp{{< /tooltip >}} Developers. For more information about the architecture of Corda 5 from the perspective of CorDapp Developers, see the [Key Concepts section]({{< relref "../key-concepts/cordapp-dev/_index.md" >}}). Depending on the stage of development, Corda supports the following types of networks:

* [Static](#static-networks)
* [Dynamic](#dynamic-networks)

## Static Networks

Static networks are intended for local testing when the list of virtual nodes or members in the network are predetermined.
These networks are composed of only a single cluster as there is no instance of the Membership Group Manager ({{< tooltip >}}MGM{{< /tooltip >}}) to distribute member data across clusters.
For information about deploying locally to a static network with the combined worker, see the [Getting Started Using the CSDE]({{< relref "../../../../tools-corda5/csde/_index.md" >}}) section.

## Dynamic Networks

Dynamic networks are used for the following:

* Production networks
* Testing across multiple clusters
* Testing when the number of members are not predetermined in your test network

One of the main differences to static networks is that there is a running MGM that all members must register with before they can transact among the group. The MGM is also responsible for distributing member data across clusters.
