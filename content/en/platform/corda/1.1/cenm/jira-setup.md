# JIRA Set-Up

The following are the instructions on setting up the JIRA in order to satisfy minimal requirements from the point of view
of the Identity Manager Certificate Signing Request (CSR)/Certificate Revocation Request (CRR) approval workflow. This will enable
a user to integrate such JIRA deployment with the CENM CSR/CRR approval workflow plugin.


## User Set-Up

Create a user with an administrative permissions and make sure it is assigned to the default groups:
`jira-administrators` and `jira-software-users`. The following shows an example for a `Test` user setup.

## Project Set-Up

Create two projects (one for Certificate Signing Requests and one for Certificate Revocation Requests) of the type of
`Process Management`. The following shows final settings for both projects.
