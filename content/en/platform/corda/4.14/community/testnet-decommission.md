# Corda Testnet decommissioned

{{< warning >}}
To provide the best experience for users setting up a network, we have decided to decommission the use of Testnet effective April 31, 2021. Here we highlight other options that are available to users following the removal of Testnet.

Based on your unique networking needs, we are offering a few different ways to get your network up and running.

* [Network Bootstrapper]({{< relref "network-bootstrapper.md" >}}): An easy and flexible free tool for developers who are new to Corda. With Network Bootstrapper, you can set up remote nodes on any cloud platform.

* [Corda Enterprise, Notary + CENM 90-Day Trial License](https://customerhub.r3.com/s/sign-up): Download a free trial of our Enterprise software. If you are interested in running a private network, this will help you understand the ins and outs of running a Corda network.
