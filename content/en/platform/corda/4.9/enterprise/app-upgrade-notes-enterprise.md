# Upgrading a CorDapp to Corda Enterprise Edition 4.9

{{< warning >}}
Corda Enterprise Edition 4.9 fixes a security vulnerability in the JPA notary. Before upgrading to Corda Enterprise Edition 4.9, read the guidance on [upgrading your notary service](../../../../../en/platform/corda/4.9/enterprise/notary/upgrading-the-ha-notary-service.md).
{{< /warning >}}

## Upgrading from Corda Community Edition

Before upgrading to Corda Enterprise Edition 4.9, upgrade your CorDapp to Corda Community Edition 4.9. See [Upgrading CorDapps to newer platform versions](../../../../../en/platform/corda/4.9/enterprise/app-upgrade-notes.md) for detailed instructions.

You don't need to re-compile your CorDapp to Corda Enterprise for it to run on Corda Enterprise. If you want your CorDapp to
be compatible with nodes running open source, then compile it against Corda Community Edition (formerly Open Source) 4.x.
However, if you want to leverage specific features of Corda Enterprise, such as third-party commercial database support, and don't envisage your CorDapp being run
in an open source production environment, then follow the [re-compiling for Corda Enterprise Edition 4.9](#re-compiling-for-corda-enterprise-49) guide.

{{< note >}}
Corda Enterprise and Corda Community Edition public APIs are currently identical. However, this may change for future releases.
See [Corda and Corda Enterprise compatibility](../../../../../en/platform/corda/4.9/enterprise/version-compatibility.md) guarantees for further information.

### Re-compiling for Corda Enterprise Edition 4.9

To re-compile your CorDapp for Corda Enterprise Edition 4.9, you need to:

1. Update your Gradle build file as follows.

```shell
ext.corda_release_distribution = 'com.r3.corda'
ext.corda_core_release_distribution = 'net.corda'
ext.corda_release_version = '4.9'
ext.corda_core_release_version = '4.9'
ext.corda_gradle_plugins_version = '5.0.12'
ext.kotlin_version = '1.2.71'
ext.quasar_version = '0.7.14_r3'
```

2. Specify an additional repository entry pointing to the location of the Corda Enterprise distribution and Corda dependencies. Any
dependencies on `corda-core` and/or `corda-serialization` must use the `corda_core_release_distribution` and
`corda_core_release_version`. As Corda is moving to an open core model, these core APIs are only available in open source and need to
be imported from there. Therefore, a repository entry pointing to a matching Corda Community Edition version is required.

3. Update your `quasar.jar` file. If your project is based on one of the official CordApp templates, you'll likely have a `lib/quasar.jar` file checked in. You'll only use this if you use the JUnit runner in IntelliJ. In the latest release of the CorDapp templates, this directory has
been removed.

For example:

```shell
repositories {
    // Example for Corda Enterprise
    maven {
        credentials {
            username "username"
            password "XXXXX"
        }
        url 'https://artifactory.mycompany.com/artifactory/corda-enterprise'
    }

    // Dependency on Corda Community Edition
    maven { url "https://software.r3.com/artifactory/corda" }

    // Corda dependencies for the patched Quasar version
    maven { url "https://software.r3.com/artifactory/corda-dependencies" } // access to the patched Quasar version
}
```

You can do either of the following:

* Upgrade your `quasar.jar` file to the version consistent with your Corda version.
* Delete your `lib` directory and switch to using the Gradle test runner.

You can find instructions for both options in [Running tests in IntelliJ](../community/testing.html#running-tests-in-intellij).

4. Check you're using Corda Gradle plugins version 5.0.12, and that Corda Enterprise dependencies are referenced with the right distribution.

For example:

```shell
cordaCompile "net.corda:corda-core:$corda_release_version"
testCompile "net.corda:corda-node-driver:$corda_release_version"
```

Becomes:

```shell
cordaCompile "$corda_core_release_distribution:corda-core:$corda_core_release_version" // core depends on open source
testCompile "$corda_release_distribution:corda-node-driver:$corda_release_version"     // node based tests from Enterprise
```

{{< note >}}
Corda Enterprise Edition 4.9 binaries are not publicly available. To make the dependencies available for development, either
create a mirror repository and upload them there, or add them to your local Maven repository.

You can request a copy of the Corda Enterprise Developer Pack (contains a Maven repository mirror
of all Corda Enterprise artifacts and their dependencies) from your R3 support contact.

{{< warning >}}

Version 4 of the finance CorDapp is split into the following two signed `.jar` files:

 * `corda-finance-contracts.jar`
 * `corda-finance-workflows.jar`
As there should only be one unique hashed version of `corda-finance-contracts.jar` (the hash of a contract `.jar` file undergoes strict
security checking upon transaction resolution), only a single instance of `corda-finance-contracts.jar` is published, and this is from the open source repository.

Please ensure any CorDapps that depend on `corda-finance-contracts.jar` reference this open source dependency as follows:

```shell
cordapp "$os_corda_release_distribution:corda-finance-contracts:$os_corda_release_version"
```

Where:
* ext.os_corda_release_distribution = 'net.corda'.
* ext.os_corda_release_version = '4.0'.

## Upgrading from Enterprise 4.3 or earlier

Corda Enterprise Edition 4.4 moves towards an open core strategy. Therefore, the common APIs are only available in Corda
open source, and Corda Enterprise has a binary dependency on the matching open source version. As a result, any CorDapps written against
Corda Enterprise Edition 4.4 or later will have to depend on the open source version of `corda-core`.

Therefore, you have to add the following variables to your build configuration:

```shell
ext.corda_core_release_distribution = 'net.corda'
ext.corda_core_release_version = '4.9'
```

Any dependency on `corda-core` (or `corda-serialization`) has to use these new variables to depend on the open source version of those
libraries, as follows:

```shell
cordaCompile "$corda_release_distribution:corda-core:$corda_release_version"
```

Becomes:

```shell
cordaCompile "$ext.corda_core_release_distribution:corda-core:$ext.corda_core_release_version"
```


## Upgrading from Corda Enterprise 3.x

You can only upgrade to Corda Enterprise Edition 4.9 from a previous 4.x version. To upgrade from 3.x, first upgrade to 4.x and then to 4.9. For example, 3.3 to 4.5, and then 4.5 to 4.9.
