# Corda Community Edition

Corda Community Edition is a free to use, open source version of Corda, with added optional support. By choosing to develop using this edition of Corda, you can access affordable technical support to help you take your project to market with confidence.

## What's new in Corda Community Edition

Along with the free-to-use Corda platform, Corda Community Edition comes with an affordable support package from R3, the makers of Corda. Check the [Community Edition support matrix](http://corda.net/support) to see which flexible package suits you best.

## Set up Corda Community Edition in three steps

To start using Corda Community Edition if you have never used Corda before:

1. Install the required software:
    * Java 8 JDK
    * IntelliJ IDEA
    * Git
    * Gradle

For more help finding these, use the [setup guide](community/getting-set-up.md).

2. Run the appropriate command to clone the CorDapp samples repository. CorDapps are applications that run on a Corda network:

* Java: `git clone http://github.com/corda/samples-java`
* Kotlin: `git clone http://github.com/corda/samples-kotlin`

3. Follow the [tutorials](/tutorials-index.md) to set up a Corda network and start coding your CorDapps.

## Upgrade to Corda Community Edition from Corda open source

If you are already using an open source version of Corda (Corda 4.1- Corda 4.8) and want to upgrade to Corda Community Edition, you can choose to:

* Download the `.tar` file.
* Use the Docker Image.

Follow the upgrade guides to make sure your [node](community/node-upgrade-notes.md) and [CorDapps](community/upgrade-cordapps.md) are upgraded correctly.
