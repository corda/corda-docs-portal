# Gateway Service


The Gateway Service provides a transfer layer between front-end Corda Enterprise Network Manager (CENM) interfaces, and the [Auth Service]({{< relref "../../../../../en/platform/corda/1.4/cenm/auth-service.md" >}}) that underpins authentication and authorisation in CENM.

Once installed and configured, users can connect with the Gateway Service via the [CENM CLI Tool]({{< relref "../../../../../en/platform/corda/1.4/cenm/cenm-cli-tool.md" >}}) to manage CENM service tasks. Administrators can use the Gateway Service address plus `/admin` to access the (CENM User Admin Tool)[user-admin] via a web browser.

{{< warning >}}
The Gateway Service does not need its own database - so there is no database configuration required when you are setting up.

### Install the gateway Gateway service

You can install the Gateway Service by installing the Gateway Service JAR file:

`java -jar gateway-service.jar -f config.conf`

#### Configure the Gateway Service

When you configure the Gateway Service, you need to:

1. Specify the endpoint where the Auth Service is exposed - this must match the IP or host name of the machine/VM/container and the port that is configured in the Auth Service config file.

2. Specify the SSL configuration for connecting to the Auth Service. You can do this using the [PKI tool]({{< relref "../../../../../en/platform/corda/1.4/cenm/pki-tool.md" >}}).

3. Your authentication credentials, as specified in your [Auth Service configuration]({{< relref "../../../../../en/platform/corda/1.4/cenm/auth-service.md" >}}).

4. Your Zone Service address.

You can create a configuration file as shown in the sample, and then add this to your CENM services using the command line commands below.

```
# Configuration dependent on the Auth Service install
auth {
    # This is the endpoint where the Auth Service is exposed, should be the IP or host name of
    # the machine/VM/container and the port that was configured in the Auth Service conf file
    serverUrl = "https://auth-service:8081/"
    # SSL config for connecting to the Auth Service
    # Should be the same trust store that is used when configuring the Auth Service
    # Generally generated by the PKI Tool
    sslConfig = {
        trustStore = "/usr/gateway/certificates/corda-ssl-trust-store.jks"
        trustStorePassword = "trustpass"
    }
    # Client credentials that were configured in the Auth Service conf file like so:
    # clientConfig = {
    #   clients = [
    #       {
    #           clientId = "gateway1"
    #           clientSecret = "secret1"
    #           scopes = [
    #               "accounts:admin"
    #           ]
    #           audience = [
    #               "zone",
    #               "network-map",
    #               "identity-manager"
    #           ]
    #       }
    #   ]
    clientCredentials = {
        clientId = "gateway1"
        clientSecret = "secret1"
    }
}

# CENM zone-service address
cenm {
    zoneHost: "zone-service"
    # Admin listener port of the Zone Service
    zonePort: 5063
}

# port to bind to (defaults to 8080)
server {
    port = 8080
}
```

#### Manage Gateway Service configuration

Name of the distribution: `gateway-service.jar`

* `-f, --config-file=` `--config-obfuscation-passphrase[=]` - The passphrase used in the key derivation function when generating an AES key
* `--config-obfuscation-seed[=]` - The seed used in the key derivation function to create a salt
* `-h, --help`
* `-V, --version`
