# LedgerGraph

LedgerGraph is a CorDapp you can use to get in-memory access to transaction data. If you install LedgerGraph on a node, it keeps transaction information in a graph structure. As not all transactions are related to all other transactions, there can actually be multiple components in the graph: each a directed acyclic graph (DAG).

LedgerGraph enables other CorDapps to have near real-time access to data concerning all of a nodeâ€™s transactions and their relationships. Without it, many operations would be unacceptably slow and impractical.
