# Performance-tuning a node

Great, so we have set up a test cluster, have all the CorDapps and JMeter installed, sorted out the firewall rules, we can get a request
go through via the JMeter GUI (see [View Results in Table]({{< relref "practical-considerations.md#interpreting-and-trouble-shooting-jmeter-output" >}}) for details how to verify that), we have sorted
out an initial test plan and have run a performance test, but these throughput numbers are not quite what we would like to see there.
Time to tune the node. For more information, see [Optimising node performance]({{< relref "../node/operating/optimizing.md" >}}).
