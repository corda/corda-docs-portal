# Troubleshooting, health-checking, and recovering your node

If you are a Corda Enterprise Network Manager (CENM) services user in your Corda Enterprise environment, you can make use of the CENM node troubleshooting guide.

Here you can find [troubleshooting solutions]({{< relref "../../../../1.6/cenm/troubleshooting-common-issues.md" >}}) to issues such as:

* **Verifying a service is running and responsive** - As well as the service logs, the CENM services provideendpoints which can be used to determine the current status of the service, whether it is executing and if it is reachable.
* **Nodes are not appearing in the Network Map** - The Network Map service and node is up and running, but the node cannot be seen from any other nodes on the network. There are a few different reasons why this could be:
    * The publishing of the node info was successfully, but the updated network map has not been signed yet.
    * There was an issue with the node info publishing such as the nodeâ€™s certificate was not valid.
    * The publishing of a node info is still in progress, and the Network Map service is awaiting a response from the
    Identity Manager Service.


## Corda Health Survey tool

[The Health Survey Tool]({{< relref "../../health-survey.md" >}}) is a command line utility that can be used to collect information about a node, which can be used by the R3 support team as an aid to diagnose support issues. It works by scanning a provided node base directory and archiving some of the important files. Furthermore, it does a deployment status check by connecting to the node and probing it and the firewall (if deployed externally) for information on configuration, service status, connection map and more.
