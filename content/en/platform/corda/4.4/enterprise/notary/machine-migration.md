# Notary worker migration

To migrate a notary worker from one physical machine or VM to another
follow the steps outlined below.

{{< note >}}
This applies to to the Corda notary worker and not the underlying database.
Please refer to the data migration documentation of the database, in case
a database service is located on the same machine as the notary worker.

{{< /note >}}

* Stop the service on the notary worker you are going to migrate. Other notary worker
nodes are still able to handle requests. No service downtime is expected.
* Copy the certificates directory, configuration files and Corda JAR file to the new machine.
* Update the P2P address configuration in the config file on the new machine if required.
* Start the notary worker on the new machine.
* Check the logs and monitoring service to see if the notary worker node started as expected and is successfully handling notarisation requests.
* Dispose of the old machine once the service is up and running on the new machine.
