## Corda Enterprise 4.4.6

Corda Enterprise 4.4.6 is a patch release of Corda Enterprise that fixes a security vulnerability in Corda Enterprise 4.4.5.

### Upgrade recommendation

As a developer, you should upgrade to the [latest released version of Corda](https://docs.corda.net/docs/corda-enterprise/index.html) as soon as possible. Check the latest Corda Enterprise release notes and upgrade guide [here](https://docs.corda.net/docs/corda-enterprise/release-notes-enterprise.html).

As a node operator, you should upgrade to the [latest released version of Corda](https://docs.corda.net/docs/corda-enterprise/index.html) if the fixed issues listed below are relevant to your work.

### Fixed issues

A security issue has been fixed that affects notary systems that use the JPA notary implementation in an HA configuration, and when the notary backing database has been set up using the Corda database management tool. The new version of the Corda database management tool must be re-run for the fix to take effect.


## Corda Enterprise 4.4.5

Corda Enterprise 4.4.5 is a patch release of Corda Enterprise that introduces fixes to known issues in Corda Enterprise 4.4.4.

### Upgrade recommendation

As a developer, you should upgrade to the [latest released version of Corda](https://docs.corda.net/docs/corda-enterprise/index.html) as soon as possible. Check the latest Corda Enterprise release notes and upgrade guide [here](https://docs.corda.net/docs/corda-enterprise/release-notes-enterprise.html).

As a node operator, you should upgrade to the [latest released version of Corda](https://docs.corda.net/docs/corda-enterprise/index.html) if the fixed issues listed below are relevant to your work.

### Fixed issues

* The `attachmentPresenceCache` has been removed. The functionality is duplicated in the `attachmentContent` cache in the `NodeAttachmentService`.
* We have fixed an issue that caused the Corda Firewall to throw an error when version information was requested.
* We have fixed an issue that caused the float to not reactivate after a bridge restart.
* We have fixed an issue that could cause a float to handle two connection attempts from the same bridge simultaneously.
* We have fixed an issue that misinterpreted an internal error as a bad certificate error, preventing future connection attempts.
* We have fixed an issue that can cause failure at node startup.
* We have fixed several issues that caused memory leaks. As a result, we have added two new node configuration fields - `attachmentClassLoaderCacheSize` and `enableURLConnectionCache`. See the [node configuration fields page](node/setup/corda-configuration-file.md) for details.

## Corda Enterprise 4.4.4

Corda Enterprise 4.4.4 is a patch release of Corda Enterprise that introduces fixes to known issues in Corda Enterprise 4.4.3.

### Upgrade recommendation

As a developer, you should upgrade to the [latest released version of Corda](https://docs.corda.net/docs/corda-enterprise/index.html) as soon as possible. Check the latest Corda Enterprise release notes and upgrade guide [here](https://docs.corda.net/docs/corda-enterprise/release-notes-enterprise.html).

As a node operator, you should upgrade to the [latest released version of Corda](https://docs.corda.net/docs/corda-enterprise/index.html) if the fixed issues listed below are relevant to your work.

### Fixed issues

* We have fixed an issue where the maximum length of a certificate's serial number allowed by Corda Enterprise Network Manager (CENM) was 28 digits (`NUMBER(28)` format in the database) - roughly about 93 bits of data. To extend the support (introduced in [CENM 1.2](https://docs.corda.net/docs/cenm/1.2.html)) for third-party CAs such as [SwissPKI](https://www.swisspki.com/), the Identity Manager Service can now handle certificate serial numbers with sizes up to 20 octets/bytes (160 bits) to comply with [RFC 5280](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280). In addition, the [CENM PKI Tool](https://docs.corda.net/docs/cenm/pki-tool.html) now generates certificates with serial number sizes of up to 16 octets/bytes. This fix provides better support for Node and HA tools.
* We have fixed an issue where the Corda node would not start up (when not in `dev` mode) if a Network Map Service instance was not running.

## Corda Enterprise 4.4.3

Corda Enterprise 4.4.3 is a patch release of Corda Enterprise that introduces fixes to known issues in Corda Enterprise 4.4.2.

### Upgrade recommendation

As a developer, you should upgrade to the [latest released version of Corda](https://docs.corda.net/docs/corda-enterprise/index.html) as soon as possible. Check the latest Corda Enterprise release notes and upgrade guide [here](https://docs.corda.net/docs/corda-enterprise/release-notes-enterprise.html).

As a node operator, you should upgrade to the [latest released version of Corda](https://docs.corda.net/docs/corda-enterprise/index.html) if the fixed issues listed below are relevant to your work.

### Fixed issues

* Session rollbacks are now allowed inside an entity manager.
* Sensitive information is no longer exposed as clear text on logs and terminal when using the [Database Management Tool](database-management-tool.md).
* Fixed an issue where the Classloader failed to find a Command class when Optional generic was used on Type definition.
* The [Configuraton Obfuscator tool](tools-config-obfuscator.md) has been fixed to work for HSM configuration files.
* The H2 version has been reverted to 1.4.197 to avoid a dependency issue introduced after the previous upgrade.
* A security update to prevent AMQP header spoofing has been applied.
* A previously unhandled exception in `FlowStateMachineImpl.run().initialiseFlow()` is now handled correctly.
* The CPU usage of the `NodeMeteringBackground` process has been decreased.
* The `backchainFetchBatchSize` option has been moved to the tuning section of the node configuration file.
* Fixed an error in DNS name resolution when using the [Corda Health Survey tool](health-survey.md).
* Fixed an issue where Corda Firewall did not start if its main configuration and its HSM configuration were obfuscated.
* Fixed an issue where deobfuscation options were missing from [HA Utilities](ha-utilities.md) in `generate-internal-tunnel-ssl-keystores` mode.
* Some Corda Enterprise 4.5 features have been backported to allow AKS deployment in Corda Enterprise 4.4.3.
* Fixed `vaultService.updates.subscribe` errors when running inside `STATE_MACHINE_STARTED` event handler.
* In the `graphiteOptions` section of `node.conf`, `sampleInvervallSeconds` has been changed to `sampleIntervalSeconds`.


## Corda Enterprise 4.4.2

Corda Enterprise 4.4.2 is a patch release of Corda Enterprise that introduces fixes to known issues in Corda Enterprise 4.4 and a fix to a new issue related to a recent third-party dependency update.

### Upgrade recommendation

As a developer, you should upgrade to the [latest released version of Corda](https://docs.corda.net/docs/corda-enterprise/index.html) as soon as possible. Check the latest Corda Enterprise release notes and upgrade guide [here](https://docs.corda.net/docs/corda-enterprise/release-notes-enterprise.html).

As a node operator, you should upgrade to the [latest released version of Corda](https://docs.corda.net/docs/corda-enterprise/index.html) if any of the fixed issues listed below is relevant to your work.

### Fixed issues

* A recent JDK update has broken the way we used delegated signatures for TLS (Transport Layer Security) handshakes. We have fixed this issue through patches on all affected Corda Enterprise versions (4.2+) to allow users to upgrade to the latest versions of compatible JDK distributions. If you have not upgraded to one of the patched releases yet, do not upgrade to Java 8 version `8u252` or higher.
* Fixed an issue to prevent `IndexOutOfBoundsException` from being thrown when serialising a `FlowAsyncOperation` that has maintained a reference to a `FlowLogic`. This issue occurred when constructing a `FlowAsyncOperation` from a `FlowExternalOperation` [[CORDA-3704](https://r3-cev.atlassian.net/browse/CORDA-3704)].
* Removed references to unavailable `man` command in CRaSH and fixed syntax of `output-format` command [[CORDA-3688](https://r3-cev.atlassian.net/browse/CORDA-3688)].
* Resolved a race condition in `FlowLogic.waitForLedgerCommit`.
* Addressed the following problems with the JPA notary:
    * Prevent database connection leak on unexpected DB exceptions.
    * Prevent incorrect handling of scenarios where a successful transaction containing an input state and an unspent reference state is retried.
* "In-process" Driver nodes used in testing now support custom CorDapp serialisers.

## Corda Enterprise 4.4

This release extends the [Corda Enterprise 4.3 release](https://docs.corda.net/docs/corda-enterprise/4.3/release-notes-enterprise.html)
with further performance, resilience and operational improvements.

Corda Enterprise 4.4 supports Linux for production deployments, with Windows and macOS support for development and demonstration purposes only. Please refer to product documentation for details.

Corda Enterprise 4.4 is operationally compatible with Corda (open source) 4.x and 3.x, and Corda Enterprise 4.3, 4.2, 4.1, 4.0 and 3.x, while providing enterprise-grade features and performance.


### Key new features and components


#### Corda Open Core


Starting with Corda Enterprise 4.4, Corda Enterprise and Open Source share the same core and API libraries - the Enterprise version
now has a binary dependency on the matching Open Source release. This reduces maintenance overhead, and improves API compatibility
and interoperability between the Open Source and Enterprise versions.

This change has some implications on the upgrade process (see “Upgrade Notes” section later on).



#### Further Hardware Security Module (HSM) support


This release adds support for storing the node’s CA and legal identity key in a [nCipher nShield Connect](https://www.ncipher.com/products/general-purpose-hsms/nshield-connect) HSM.
Please refer to the associated section in [Using an HSM with Corda Enterprise](node/operating/cryptoservice-configuration.md) for more details.

We also have extended the set of HSMs available for the storage of a highly-available notary’s shared service key. The notary’s shared service key can now be stored in the following HSM types:


* Utimaco
* Gemalto Luna
* nCipher



#### Performance improvements


This release introduces an optimisation for sharing transaction backchains. Corda Enterprise nodes can request backchain items in bulk instead of one at a time (the configuration property `backchainFetchBatchSize` can be used to define the size of the batch).

Responding nodes (Enterprise or Open Source) running at platform version >= 6 will supply backchain items in bulk up to half of the network’s allowed maximum message size (minimum one item; items exceeding the limit are sent in subsequent batches). Nodes running on older platform version will still supply backchain items one at a time.

The release also includes the ability to configure the timeout and buffer size that ActiveMQ Artemis uses to flush produced messages to disk and send acknowledgements back to the client. This is exposed via a set of additional node configuration properties (`journalBufferTimeout`, `journalBufferSize` and `brokerConnectionTtlCheckIntervalMs`). Optimizing these values for your particular use case may result in improved latency depending on the characteristics of the hardware infrastructure.



#### HA Notary registration process improvements


We have introduced a set of improvements to make it easier to register a highly-available notary onto a Corda network:


* The keystore containing the notary identity key that is generated during registration is given a name that clearly disambiguates it from a regular node keystore
* The notary can now be registered using its X500 name, as an alternative to providing a node info file. This allows the notary to be added to the network parameters before the notary is registered, and avoids the need to copy the node info file around between notary workers
* HA notary workers can retrieve the notary’s service certificate from the network map service, avoiding the need to manually copy it around between the various workers
* HA notary workers check they have access to the shared notary service key and certificate before they register with the notary



#### Corda Health Survey improvements


We have improved the Corda Health Survey tool to support a fuller range of node commissioning tasks, including:


* Verifying connectivity with other peers and Notaries
* Validating more complex deployments of Corda Enterprise (including HA node-Firewall combinations)
* Further connectivity checks on network infrastructure (check CRL endpoint via the Bridge)
* Further validation of node functionality (RPC connectivity)
* Warning operators that the node or Firewall configuration files are not obfuscated

Furthermore, we have improved the overall usability of the tool by adding support for running the tool via RPC.

The new version of the tool can only be used on Corda Enterprise 4.4 (and above) nodes. Peer connectivity checks can target any node or Notary running on the same network.



#### Configuration Obfuscator improvements


The Configuration Obfuscator has been improved to:


* Use a more robust key derivation function (PBKDF2 with HMAC-SHA256)
*
    * keyboard input (stdin)
    * Command-line
    * Environment variables



The new version of the tool is also able to de-obfuscate files obfuscated with older versions.

The new version of the tool can only be used with Corda Enterprise 4.4 (and above) node and Firewall configuration files.



### Known issues


### Upgrade notes

From Corda Enterprise 4.4 onwards, we are moving towards an open core strategy. Common APIs shared by Corda Enterprise will only be available in Corda Open Source. Therefore, any CorDapps written against Corda Enterprise 4.4 or later will have to depend on the open source version of `corda-core`.

As per previous major releases, we have provided a [comprehensive upgrade guide](app-upgrade-notes-enterprise.md) to ease the upgrade
of CorDapps to Corda Enterprise 4.4.
