# Obtaining and installing the performance test suite

As a registered user of Corda Enterprise, you can get the performance test suite as a zip file from the same location where the Corda
Enterprise artifacts are available. Look for a file called `jmeter-corda-<version>-testsuite.zip`.


## File contents

The performance test suite is shipped as a `.zip` file containing the following files:

* `jmeter-corda-<version>-capsule.jar`: A fat `.jar` file that contains the wrapped JMeter code to drive performance tests as well as all the required dependencies to run the JMeter application. It is referred to as `jmeter-corda.jar` throughout on this and other related pages in the Corda documentation.
* `corda-ptflows-<version>.jar`: A performance test CorDapp used by the built-in samplers and the included sample test plans. If you intend to use these test plans, you should deploy this CorDapp to any node of the system under test. The CorDapp itself is called `com.r3.corda.enterprise.perftestcordapp`.
* `settlement-perftest-cordapp-<version>.jar`: A performance test CorDapp used by the built-in samplers and the included sample test plans. If you intend to use these test plans, you should deploy this CorDapp to any node of the system under test. For more information, see [introduction](introduction.html#performance-test-cordapp).
* A number of test plan `.jmx` files. For more information, see [included testplans](jmeter-testplans.md#included-testplans).
* `jmeter.properties`: An example of the `jmeter.properties` file used to configure JMeter. If you need a custom configuration, you should base it on this file.
* `sample-server-rmi.config`: An annotated sample for the server RMI mapping required to use remote JMeter over SSH tunnels. For more information, see [SSH Tunnel Set-Up](running-jmeter-corda.md#ssh-tunnel).


## Installation


### Client installation

Simply create a working directory for JMeter Corda on the client machine and unzip the performance test suite to this
directory. This app requires an Oracle JRE version 1.8 build 172 or later. After unpacking,
you should immediately be able to run it from a shell by typing `java -jar jmeter-corda.jar`. Please refer to
[Running JMeter Corda](running-jmeter-corda.md) for details and command line options.



### Installing JMeter server

The same JAR file used for running the client can be run as a server as well by starting it with the `-s` flag as part
of the JMeter arguments. It can be installed by simply copying the JAR file to the server and having an adequate JRE
installed.

If SSH tunneling is in use, the server will also need access to the same RMI port mappings file used on the client side.
Also, if the client side uses a customised JMeter properties file that differs from the default one baked into the JMeter
JAR file by more than just the
list of remote host names from, this needs to be used on the server side as well. See [Running JMeter Corda](running-jmeter-corda.md)
for details on the command line options required. A typical command line might look like this:

```kotlin
java -jar <path to jmeter-corda jar> -XjmeterProperties <path to properties file> -XserverRmiMappings <path to RMI mappings file> -- -s
```

If you want to use JMeter Corda remotely, it is suggested to install the JMeter server as a system service on the servers
it is required to run on. Assuming a Linux system with a systemd-based run control, the service to install would look
something like this:

```kotlin
[Unit]
Description=Jmeter Corda
Requires=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=<jmeter Corda user>
WorkingDirectory=<jmeter deploy directory>
ExecStart=/usr/bin/java -Xmx512m -jar <JMeter deploy directory>/jmeter-corda.jar -XjmeterProperties <path to properties file> -XserverRmiMappings <path to RMI mappings file> -- -s
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
