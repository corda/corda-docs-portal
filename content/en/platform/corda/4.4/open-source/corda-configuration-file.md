# Node configuration

{{< warning >}}
If not specified in the node configuration file, `devMode` defaults to `True`. `devMode` must be disabled on all
production nodes.
{{< /warning >}}

## Configuration file location

When starting a node, the `corda.jar` file defaults to reading the node’s configuration from a `node.conf` file in the directory from which the command to launch Corda is executed.
There are two command-line options to override this behaviour:

* The `--config-file` command line option allows you to specify a configuration file with a different name, or in a different file location.
Paths are relative to the current working directory
* The `--base-directory` command line option allows you to specify the node’s workspace location.
A `node.conf` configuration file is then expected in the root of this workspace.

If you specify both command line arguments at the same time, the node will fail to start.

## Configuration file format

The Corda configuration file uses the HOCON format which is a superset of JSON. Please visit
[https://github.com/typesafehub/config/blob/master/HOCON.md](https://github.com/typesafehub/config/blob/master/HOCON.md) for further details.

Please do NOT use double quotes (`"`) in configuration keys.

Node setup will log `Config files should not contain " in property names. Please fix: [key]` as an error when it finds double quotes around keys.
This prevents configuration errors when mixing keys containing `.` wrapped with double quotes and without them e.g.: The property
`"dataSourceProperties.dataSourceClassName" = "val"` in [Reference.conf](#reference-conf) would be not overwritten by the property
`dataSourceProperties.dataSourceClassName = "val2"` in *node.conf*.

{{< warning >}}
If a property is defined twice the last one will take precedence. The library currently used for parsing HOCON
currently does not provide a way to catch duplicates when parsing files and will silently override values for the same key.
For example having `key=initialValue` defined first in node.conf and later on down the
lines `key=overridingValue` will result into the value being `overridingValue`.

{{< /warning >}}

By default the node will fail to start in presence of unknown property keys.
To alter this behaviour, the `on-unknown-config-keys` command-line argument can be set to `IGNORE` (default is `FAIL`).

{{< note >}}
As noted in the HOCON documentation, the default behaviour for resources referenced within a config file is to silently
ignore them if missing. Therefore it is strongly recommended to utilise the `required` syntax for includes. See HOCON documentation
for more information.

{{< /note >}}

## Overriding configuration values

### Placeholder Overrides

It is possible to add placeholders to the `node.conf` file to override particular settings via environment variables. In this case the
`rpcSettings.address` property will be overridden by the `RPC_ADDRESS` environment variable, and the node will fail to load if this
environment variable isn’t present (see: [Hiding sensitive data](node-administration.md#hiding-sensitive-data) for more information).

```groovy
rpcSettings {
  address=${RPC_ADDRESS}
  adminAddress="localhost:10015"
}
```

### Direct Overrides

It is also possible to directly override Corda configuration (regardless of whether the setting is already in the `node.conf`), by using
environment variables or JVM options. Simply prefix the field with `corda.` or `corda_`, using periods (`.`) or
underscores (`_`) to signify nested options. For example, to override the `rpcSettings.address` setting, you can override it via environment variables:

```shell
# For *nix systems:
export corda_rpcSettings_address=localhost:10015

# On Windows systems:
SET corda_rpcSettings_address=localhost:10015
SET corda.rpcSettings.address=localhost:10015
```

Or via JVM arguments:

```shell
java -Dcorda_rpcSettings_address=localhost:10015 -jar corda.jar
java -Dcorda.rpcSettings.address=localhost:10015 -jar corda.jar
```

Items in lists can be overridden by appending the list index to the configuration key. For example, the `jarDirs` setting can be
overridden via:

```shell
# via JVM arguments:
java -Dcorda.jarDirs.0=./libs -Dcorda.jarDirs.1=./morelibs -jar corda.jar
java -Dcorda_jarDirs_0=./libs -Dcorda_jarDirs_1=./morelibs -jar corda.jar

# or via environment variables

# for *nix systems:
export corda_jarDirs_0=./libs
export corda_jarDirs_1=./morelibs

# for Windows systems:
SET corda.jarDirs.0=./libs
SET corda.jarDirs.1=./morelibs
# or
SET corda_jarDirs_0=./libs
SET corda_jarDirs_1=./morelibs
```

#### Limitations

* If the same key is overridden by both an environment variable and system property, the system property takes precedence.
* Variables and properties are case sensitive. Corda will warn you if a variable
prefixed with `CORDA` cannot be mapped to a valid property. Shadowing occurs when two properties
of the same type with the same key are defined. For example having `corda_p2Aaddress=host:port` and `corda_p2Aaddress=host1:port1`
will raise an exception on startup. This is to prevent mistakes that are hard to spot.
* If an item in a list is overridden via an environment variable/system property, the whole list will be overridden. E.g., with a `node.conf`
containing:

```groovy
jarDirs=["./dir1", "./dir2", "./dir3"]
```

When Corda is started via:

```shell
java -Dcorda.jarDirs_0=./newdir1
```

The resulting value of `jarDirs` will be `["./newdir1"]`.

* You can’t override a populated list with an empty list. For example, when `devMode=false`, `cordappSignerKeyFingerprintBlacklist` is
pre-populated with Corda development keys. It isn’t possible to set this to an empty list via the commandline. You can however override
the list with an all zero hash which will remove the keys:

```shell
java -Dcorda.cordappSignerKeyFingerprintBlacklist.0="0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
```

* Objects in lists cannot currently be overridden. For example the `rpcUsers` configuration key is a list of user objects, overriding these
via environment variables or system properties will not work.

## Configuration file fields

{{< note >}}
The available configuration fields are listed below in alphabetic order.
{{< /note >}}

`additionalP2PAddresses`

  An array of additional host:port values, which will be included in the advertised NodeInfo in the network map in addition to the `p2pAddress`.
  Nodes can use this configuration option to advertise HA endpoints and aliases to external parties.

{{< note >}}
0.0.0.0 is not a valid host setting since each additionalP2PAddress must be an external client address.
{{< /note >}}

  *Default:* empty list

`attachmentContentCacheSizeMegaBytes`

  Optionally specify how much memory should be used to cache attachment contents in memory.

  *Default:* 10MB

`attachmentCacheBound`

  Optionally specify how many attachments should be cached locally. Note that this includes only the key and metadata, the content is cached separately and can be loaded lazily.

  *Default:* 1024

`blacklistedAttachmentSigningKeys`

  List of SHA-256 hashes of public keys. Attachments signed by any of these public keys will not be considered as trust roots for any attachments received over the network.
  This property is similar to `cordappSignerKeyFingerprintBlacklist` but only restricts CorDapps that were
  included as attachments in a transaction and received over the network from a peer.

  This property requires retrieving the hashes of public keys that need to be blacklisted.

   *Default:* not defined

`compatibilityZoneURL` **deprecated**

  The root address of the Corda compatibility zone network management services, it is used by the Corda node to register with the network and obtain a Corda node certificate, and also is used by the node to obtain network map information.
  Cannot be set at the same time as the `networkServices` option.

  **Important:  This configuration value is deprecated, please use `networkServices`**

  *Default:* not defined

`cordappSignerKeyFingerprintBlacklist`

  List of the public keys fingerprints (SHA-256 of public key hash) not allowed as Cordapp JARs signers.
  The node will not load Cordapps signed by those keys.
  The option takes effect only in production mode and defaults to Corda development keys (``["56CA54E803CB87C8472EBD3FBC6A2F1876E814CEEBF74860BD46997F40729367", "83088052AF16700457AE2C978A7D8AC38DD6A7C713539D00B897CD03A5E5D31D"]``), in development mode any key is allowed to sign Cordpapp JARs.

  This property requires retrieving the hashes of public keys that need to be blacklisted.

  *Default:* not defined

`crlCheckSoftFail`
  This is a boolean flag that when enabled (i.e. ``true`` value is set) causes certificate revocation list (CRL) checking to use soft fail mode.
  Soft fail mode allows the revocation check to succeed if the revocation status cannot be determined because of a network error.
  If this parameter is set to ``false`` rigorous CRL checking takes place. This involves each certificate in the certificate path being checked for a CRL distribution point extension, and that this extension points to a URL serving a valid CRL.
  This means that if any CRL URL in the certificate path is inaccessible, the connection with the other party will fail and be marked as bad.
  Additionally, if any certificate in the hierarchy, including the self-generated node SSL certificate, is missing a valid CRL URL, then the certificate path will be marked as invalid.

  *Default:* true

`custom`
  Set custom command line attributes (e.g. Java system properties) on the node process via the capsule launcher

  `jvmArgs`:
   A list of JVM arguments to apply to the node process. This removes any defaults specified from ``corda.jar``, but can be overridden from the command line.

   *Default:* not defined

`database`
  Database configuration

  `transactionIsolationLevel`:
    Transaction isolation level as defined by the ``TRANSACTION_`` constants in ``java.sql.Connection``, but without the ``TRANSACTION_`` prefix.

   *Default:* ``REPEATABLE_READ``

  `exportHibernateJMXStatistics`:
    Whether to export Hibernate JMX statistics.

   **Caution: enabling this option causes expensive run-time overhead**

   *Default:* false

  `initialiseSchema`
    Boolean which indicates whether to update the database schema at startup (or create the schema when node starts for the first time).
    If set to ``false`` on startup, the node will validate if it's running against a compatible database schema.

   *Default:* true

  `initialiseAppSchema`
    The property allows to override ``database.initialiseSchema`` for the Hibernate DDL generation for CorDapp schemas.
    ``UPDATE`` performs an update of CorDapp schemas, while ``VALID`` only verifies their integrity and ``NONE`` performs no check.
    When ``initialiseSchema`` is set to ``false``, then ``initialiseAppSchema`` may be set as ``VALID`` or ``NONE`` only.

   *Default:* CorDapp schema creation is controlled with ``initialiseSchema``.


`dataSourceProperties`
  This section is used to configure the JDBC connection and database driver used for the node's persistence.
  To add additional data source properties (for a specific JDBC driver) use the ``dataSource.`` prefix with the property name (e.g. ``dataSource.customProperty = value``).

  `dataSourceClassName`
    JDBC Data Source class name.

  `dataSource.url`
    JDBC database URL.

  `dataSource.user`
    Database user.

  `dataSource.password`
    Database password.

  *Default:*


```
dataSourceClassName = org.h2.jdbcx.JdbcDataSource
dataSource.url = "jdbc:h2:file:"${baseDirectory}"/persistence;DB_CLOSE_ON_EXIT=FALSE;WRITE_DELAY=0;LOCK_TIMEOUT=10000"
dataSource.user = sa
dataSource.password = ""
```

`detectPublicIp`
  This flag toggles the auto IP detection behaviour.
  If enabled, on startup the node will attempt to discover its externally visible IP address first by looking for any public addresses on its network interfaces, and then by sending an IP discovery request to the network map service.
  Set to ``true`` to enable.

  *Default:* false

`devMode`
  This flag sets the node to run in development mode.
  On startup, if the keystore ``<workspace>/certificates/sslkeystore.jks``
  does not exist, a developer keystore will be used if ``devMode`` is true.
  The node will exit if ``devMode`` is false and the keystore does not exist.
  ``devMode`` also turns on background checking of flow checkpoints to shake out any bugs in the checkpointing process.
  Also, if ``devMode`` is true, Hibernate will try to automatically create the schema required by Corda or update an existing schema in the SQL database; if ``devMode`` is false, Hibernate will simply validate the existing schema, failing on node start if the schema is either not present or not compatible.
  If no value is specified in the node configuration file, the node will attempt to detect if it's running on a developer machine and set ``devMode=true`` in that case.
  This value can be overridden from the command line using the ``--dev-mode`` option.

  This flag affects the default value for Java heap size.

  *Default:* Corda will try to establish based on OS environment

`devModeOptions`
  Allows modification of certain ``devMode`` features

  **Important: This is an unsupported configuration.**

  `allowCompatibilityZone`
    Allows a node configured to operate in development mode to connect to a compatibility zone.

    *Default:* not defined


`emailAddress`
  The email address responsible for node administration, used by the Compatibility Zone administrator.

  *Default:* company@example.com


`extraNetworkMapKeys`
  An optional list of private network map UUIDs. Your node will fetch the public network and private network maps based on these keys.
  Private network UUID should be provided by network operator and lets you see nodes not visible on public network.

  **Important: This is a temporary feature for onboarding network participants that limits their visibility for privacy reasons.**

  *Default:* not defined

`flowExternalOperationThreadPoolSize`
  The number of threads available to execute external operations that have been called from flows.

*Default:* Set to the lesser of either the maximum number of cores allocated to the node, or 10.

`flowMonitorPeriodMillis`
  Duration of the period suspended flows waiting for IO are logged.

  *Default:* 60 seconds

`flowMonitorSuspensionLoggingThresholdMillis`
  Threshold duration suspended flows waiting for IO need to exceed before they are logged.

  *Default:* 60 seconds

`flowTimeout`
  When a flow implementing the ``TimedFlow`` interface and setting the ``isTimeoutEnabled`` flag does not complete within a defined elapsed time, it is restarted from the initial checkpoint.
  Currently only used for notarisation requests with clustered notaries: if a notary cluster member dies while processing a notarisation request, the client flow eventually times out and gets restarted.
  On restart the request is resent to a different notary cluster member in a round-robin fashion. Note that the flow will keep retrying forever.

  `timeout`
    The initial flow timeout period.

    *Default:* 30 seconds

  `maxRestartCount`
    The number of retries the back-off time keeps growing for.
    For subsequent retries, the timeout value will remain constant.

    *Default:* 6

  `backoffBase`
    The base of the exponential backoff, `t_{wait} = timeout * backoffBase^{retryCount}`

    *Default:* 1.8

`h2Port` (deprecated)
  Defines port for h2 DB.

  **Important: Deprecated please use `h2Setting` instead**


`h2Settings`
  Sets the H2 JDBC server host and port.
  For non-localhost address the database password needs to be set in ``dataSourceProperties``.

  *Default:* NULL


`jarDirs`
  An optional list of file system directories containing JARs to include in the classpath when launching via ``corda.jar`` only.
  Each should be a string.
  Only the JARs in the directories are added, not the directories themselves.
  This is useful for including JDBC drivers and the like. e.g. ``jarDirs = [ ${baseDirectory}"/libs" ]``.
  (Note that you have to use the ``baseDirectory`` substitution value when pointing to a relative path).

{{< note >}}
If an item in a list is overridden via an environment variable/system property, the whole list will be overridden. This mechanism should not be used for CorDapps directory.
{{< /note >}}

  *Default:* not defined

`jmxMonitoringHttpPort`
  If set, will enable JMX metrics reporting via the Jolokia HTTP/JSON agent on the corresponding port.
  Default Jolokia access url is http://127.0.0.1:port/jolokia/

  *Default:* not defined

`jmxReporterType`
  Provides an option for registering an alternative JMX reporter.
  Available options are ``JOLOKIA`` and ``NEW_RELIC``.

  The Jolokia configuration is provided by default.
  The New Relic configuration leverages the Dropwizard NewRelicReporter solution.

  *Default:* ``JOLOKIA``

`keyStorePassword`
  The password to unlock the KeyStore file (``<workspace>/certificates/sslkeystore.jks``) containing the node certificate and private key.

  **Important: This is the non-secret value for the development certificates automatically generated during the first node run.
  Longer term these keys will be managed in secure hardware devices.**

  *Default:* cordacadevpass

`lazyBridgeStart`
  Internal option.

  **Important: Please do not change.**

  *Default:* true

`messagingServerAddress`
  The address of the ArtemisMQ broker instance.
  If not provided the node will run one locally.
  0.0.0.0 should not be specified since this needs to be a valid client address.

  *Default:* not defined

`messagingServerExternal`
  If ``messagingServerAddress`` is specified the default assumption is that the artemis broker is running externally.
  Setting this to ``false`` overrides this behaviour and runs the artemis internally to the node, but bound to the address specified in ``messagingServerAddress``.
  This allows the address and port advertised in ``p2pAddress`` to differ from the local binding, especially if there is external remapping by firewalls, load balancers , or routing rules. Note that ``detectPublicIp`` should be set to ``false`` to ensure that no translation of the ``p2pAddress`` occurs before it is sent to the network map.

  *Default:* not defined


`myLegalName`
  The legal identity of the node.
  This acts as a human-readable alias to the node's public key and can be used with the network map to look up the node's info.
  This is the name that is used in the node's certificates (either when requesting them from the doorman, or when auto-generating them in dev mode).
  At runtime, Corda checks whether this name matches the name in the node's certificates.

  *Default:* not defined

`notary`
  Optional configuration object which if present configures the node to run as a notary. If running as part of a HA notary cluster, please
  specify the ``serviceLegalName`` and either the ``mysql`` (deprecated) or ``jpa`` configuration as described below. For a single-node notary only the ``validating`` property is required.

  `validating`
    Boolean to determine whether the notary is a validating or non-validating one.

    *Default:* false

  `serviceLegalName`
    If the node is part of a distributed cluster, specify the legal name of the cluster.
    At runtime, Corda checks whether this name matches the name of the certificate of the notary cluster.

    *Default:* not defined


  `etaMessageThresholdSeconds`
    If the wait time estimate on the internal queue exceeds this value, the notary may send
    a wait time update to the client (implementation specific and dependent on the counter
    party version).

    *Default:* Implementation dependent

  `raft`
    *(Deprecated)* If part of a distributed Raft cluster, specify this configuration object with the following settings:

      `nodeAddress`
        The host and port to which to bind the embedded Raft server. Note that the Raft cluster uses a
        separate transport layer for communication that does not integrate with ArtemisMQ messaging services.

        *Default:* not defined

      `clusterAddresses`
        Must list the addresses of all the members in the cluster. At least one of the members must
        be active and be able to communicate with the cluster leader for the node to join the cluster. If empty, a
        new cluster will be bootstrapped.

        *Default:* not defined

  `bftSMaRt`
    *(Deprecated)* If part of a distributed BFT-SMaRt cluster, specify this configuration object with the following settings:

      `replicaId`
        The zero-based index of the current replica. All replicas must specify a unique replica id.

        *Default:* not defined

      `clusterAddresses`
        Must list the addresses of all the members in the cluster. At least one of the members must
        be active and be able to communicate with the cluster leader for the node to join the cluster. If empty, a
        new cluster will be bootstrapped.

        *Default:* not defined

`networkParameterAcceptanceSettings`
  Optional settings for managing the network parameter auto-acceptance behaviour.
  If not provided then the defined defaults below are used.

  `autoAcceptEnabled`
    This flag toggles auto accepting of network parameter changes.
    If a network operator issues a network parameter change which modifies only auto-acceptable options and this behaviour is enabled then the changes will be accepted without any manual intervention from the node operator.
    See [Network map](network-map.md) for more information on the update process and current auto-acceptable parameters.
    Set to ``false`` to disable.

    *Default:* true

  `excludedAutoAcceptableParameters`
    List of auto-acceptable parameter names to explicitly exclude from auto-accepting.
    Allows a node operator to control the behaviour at a more granular level.

    *Default:* empty list


`networkServices`
  If the Corda compatibility zone services, both network map and registration (doorman), are not running on the same endpoint
  and thus have different URLs then this option should be used in place of the ``compatibilityZoneURL`` setting.

  **Important: Only one of ``compatibilityZoneURL`` or ``networkServices`` should be used.**

  `doormanURL`
    Root address of the network registration service.

    *Default:* not defined

  `networkMapURL`
    Root address of the network map service.

    *Default:* not defined

  `pnm`
    Optional UUID of the private network operating within the compatibility zone this node should be joining.

    *Default:* not defined

  `csrToken`
    Optional token to provide alongside the certificate signing request (CSR) as part of the HTTP header during node registration.
    The token can be used by certificate signing authority (or Identity Manager Service) to verify additional identity requirements.
    The maximum token length is limited by the maximum HTTP header size, which is normally 8KB, assuming that a few other internal
    attributes are also present in the header. Also, the token length itself may never exceed 8192, limited by the database structure.
    Only US-ASCII characters are allowed.

    *Default:* not defined


`p2pAddress`
  The host and port on which the node is available for protocol operations over ArtemisMQ.

  In practice the ArtemisMQ messaging services bind to **all local addresses** on the specified port.
  However, note that the host is the included as the advertised entry in the network map.
  As a result the value listed here must be **externally accessible when running nodes across a cluster of machines.**
  If the provided host is unreachable, the node will try to auto-discover its public one.
  0.0.0.0 is not a valid host setting since p2pAddress must be an external client address.

  *Default:* not defined

`relay`
  If provided, the node will attempt to tunnel inbound connections via an external relay. The relay's address will be
  advertised to the network map service instead of the provided ``p2pAddress``.

  `relayHost`
    Hostname of the relay machine

  `remoteInboundPort`
    A port on the relay machine that accepts incoming TCP connections. Traffic will be forwarded from this port to the local port specified in ``p2pAddress``.

  `username`
    Username for establishing an SSH connection with the relay.

  `privateKeyFile`
    Path to the private key file for SSH authentication. The private key must not have a passphrase.

  `publicKeyFile`
    Path to the public key file for SSH authentication.

  `sshPort`
    Port to be used for SSH connection, default ``22``.

`rpcAddress` (deprecated)
  The address of the RPC system on which RPC requests can be made to the node.
  If not provided then the node will run without RPC.

  **Important: Deprecated. Use rpcSettings instead.**

  *Default:* not defined


`rpcSettings`
  Options for the RPC server exposed by the Node.

  **Important: The RPC SSL certificate is used by RPC clients to authenticate the connection.  The Node operator must provide RPC clients with a truststore containing the certificate they can trust.  We advise Node operators to not use the P2P keystore for RPC.  The node can be run with the "generate-rpc-ssl-settings" command, which generates a secure keystore and truststore that can be used to secure the RPC connection. You can use this if you have no special requirements.**

    `address`
      host and port for the RPC server binding.

      *Default:* not defined

    `adminAddress`
      host and port for the RPC admin binding (this is the endpoint that the node process will connect to).

      *Default:* not defined

    `standAloneBroker`
      boolean, indicates whether the node will connect to a standalone broker for RPC.

      *Default:* false

    `useSsl`
      boolean, indicates whether or not the node should require clients to use SSL for RPC connections.

      *Default:* false

    `ssl`
      (mandatory if ``useSsl=true``) SSL settings for the RPC server.

      `keyStorePath`
        Absolute path to the key store containing the RPC SSL certificate.

      *Default:* not defined

      `keyStorePassword`
        Password for the key store.

        *Default:* not defined

`rpcUsers`
  A list of users who are authorised to access the RPC system.
  Each user in the list is a configuration object with the following fields:

  `username`
    Username consisting only of word characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9 and _)

    *Default:* not defined

  `password`
    The password

    *Default:* not defined

  `permissions`
    A list of permissions for starting flows via RPC.
    To give the user the permission to start the flow ``foo.bar.FlowClass``, add the string ``StartFlow.foo.bar.FlowClass`` to the list.
    If the list contains the string ``ALL``, the user can start any flow via RPC. Wildcards are also allowed, for example ``StartFlow.foo.bar.*``
    will allow the user to start any flow within the ``foo.bar`` package.
    This value is intended for administrator users and for development.

    *Default:* not defined

`security`
  Contains various nested fields controlling user authentication/authorization, in particular for RPC accesses.


`sshd`
  If provided, node will start internal SSH server which will provide a management shell.
  It uses the same credentials and permissions as RPC subsystem.
  It has one required parameter.

  `port`
    The port to start SSH server on e.g. ``sshd { port = 2222 }``.

    *Default:* not defined

`systemProperties`
  An optional map of additional system properties to be set when launching via ``corda.jar`` only.
  Keys and values of the map should be strings. e.g. ``systemProperties = { "visualvm.display.name" = FooBar }``

  *Default:* not defined

`transactionCacheSizeMegaBytes`
  Optionally specify how much memory should be used for caching of ledger transactions in memory.

  *Default:* 8 MB plus 5% of all heap memory above 300MB.

`tlsCertCrlDistPoint`
  CRL distribution point (i.e. URL) for the TLS certificate.
  Default value is NULL, which indicates no CRL availability for the TLS certificate.

  **Important: This needs to be set if crlCheckSoftFail is false (i.e. strict CRL checking is on).**

  *Default:* NULL


`tlsCertCrlIssuer`
  CRL issuer (given in the X500 name format) for the TLS certificate.
  Default value is NULL, which indicates that the issuer of the TLS certificate is also the issuer of the CRL.

  **Important: If this parameter is set then `tlsCertCrlDistPoint` needs to be set as well.**

  *Default:* NULL


`trustStorePassword`
  The password to unlock the Trust store file (``<workspace>/certificates/truststore.jks``) containing the Corda network root certificate.
  This is the non-secret value for the development certificates automatically generated during the first node run.

  *Default:* trustpass

`useTestClock`
  Internal option.

  **Important: Please do not change.**

  *Default:* false


`verfierType`
  Internal option.

  **Important: Please do not change.**

  *Default:* InMemory

## Reference.conf

A set of default configuration options are loaded from the built-in resource file `/node/src/main/resources/reference.conf`.
This file can be found in the `:node` gradle module of the [Corda repository](https://github.com/corda/corda).
Any options you do not specify in your own `node.conf` file will use these defaults.

Here are the contents of the `reference.conf` file:

```none
additionalP2PAddresses = []
crlCheckSoftFail = true
database = {
    transactionIsolationLevel = "REPEATABLE_READ"
    exportHibernateJMXStatistics = "false"
}

    dataSource.url = "jdbc:h2:file:"${baseDirectory}"/persistence;DB_CLOSE_ON_EXIT=FALSE;WRITE_DELAY=0;LOCK_TIMEOUT=10000"
    dataSource.user = sa
    dataSource.password = ""
}

## Generating a public key hash

This section details how a public key hash can be extracted and generated from a signed CorDapp. This is required for a select number of
configuration properties.

Below are the steps to generate a hash for a CorDapp signed with a RSA certificate. A similar process should work for other certificate types.

* Extract the contents of the signed CorDapp jar.
* Run the following command (replacing the < > variables):

```none
openssl pkcs7 -in <extract_signed_jar_directory>/META-INF/<signature_to_hash>.RSA -print_certs -inform DER -outform DER \
| openssl x509 -pubkey -noout \
| openssl rsa -pubin -outform der | openssl dgst -sha256
```

* Copy the public key hash that is generated and place it into the required location (e.g. in `node.conf`).
