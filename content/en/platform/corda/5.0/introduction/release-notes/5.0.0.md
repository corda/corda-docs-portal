# Corda 5.0 Beta 4 Release Notes
Due to demand, Corda 5.0 Beta 4 has been published to unveil what can be expected in the upcoming GA release. Essentially, Corda 5.0 Beta 4 is a pre-release of the next generation Corda 5.0, although there are differences and some known limitations.

Following on from Corda 4, this release introduces the concept of a virtual node and it runs on a new architecture with a new technology stack to provide the foundations for running Corda at scale. Corda 5.0 Beta 4 will remain available until the official publication of Corda 5.0 GA, which is expected in July 2023.

## Known Issues and Limitations

* The Corda 5.0 API is a breaking change from the Corda 4.x APIs and requires Corda Distributed Application (CorDapp) developers to port their CorDapps to the new Corda 5.0 Java-based API.
* Upgrades and/or migrations from Corda 4.x and previous Corda 5 Beta releases are not supported in this release, but guidance for this will be provided in a later release.
* CorDapp flow latency and throughput is not targeted for production workloads; this will be addressed in a later release.
