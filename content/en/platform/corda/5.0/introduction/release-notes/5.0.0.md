# Corda 5.0.0 Release Notes
This is the release of the next generation of Corda. This major new release introduces the concept of a virtual node and it runs on a new architecture with a new technology stack to provide the foundations for running Corda at scale. 

Corda 5.0 will be supported on a short-term support cycle and will be supported by R3 until a long-term support release is available. Refer to [End of Life Strategy]({{< relref "../about-the-docs.md#end-of-life-strategy">}}).

## Known Issues and Limitations

* The Corda 5.0 API is a breaking change from the Corda 4x API and requires Corda distributed application (CorDapp) developers to port their CorDapps to the new Corda 5.0 Java based API

* Upgrades and/or migrations from Corda 4.x and Corda 5 Beta releases are not supported in this release, but guidance for this will be provided in a later release.

* CorDapp flow latency and throughput is not targeted for production workloads; this will be addressed in a later release.

* Upgrades to the Corda platform software currently require a restart of the Corda platform; this will be addressed in a later release.
