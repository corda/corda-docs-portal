# Corda 5.0.0 Release Notes

Next-Gen Corda is now Generally Available (GA) after an extensive beta program. Corda is a distributed application platform for the creation and operation of decentralized applications, written using a rich Java API, to orchestrate updates to an immutable distributed ledger. 

Corda 5.0 introduces the concept of a virtual node and it runs on a new architecture with a new cloud native technology stack to provide the foundations for running Corda at scale. 

## Known Issues and Limitations

* The Corda 5.0 API is a breaking change from the Corda 4.x APIs and requires Corda Distributed Application (CorDapp) developers to port their CorDapps to the new Corda 5.0 Java-based API.
* Upgrades or migrations from previous Corda 5 Beta releases are not supported.
* If an identifiable input {{< tooltip >}}state{{< /tooltip >}} is split into two new identifiable output states with the same ID, the identifier exclusivity rule is violated but no error presents.
