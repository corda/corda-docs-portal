Corda 5 implements role-based access control (RBAC) permission system, also known as role-based security, as a mechanism to restrict system access.
It entails configuring permissions and privileges to grant authorized users access. This section describes different entities that the RBAC system is made of
as well as ways to create fine-grained roles with different permissions assigned to them.
