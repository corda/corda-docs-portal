# Kubernetes Liveness and Readiness Probes
All the Corda worker pods are configured with Kubernetes liveness and readiness probes.
These poll the status of the workerâ€™s internal component registry.

If any component reports that it is in an error state, the liveness probe fails and Kubernetes eventually restarts the pod.
During normal operation, pods should not cause failures of the liveness probe and the Cluster Administrator should monitor for failures in the Kubernetes events stream.

The readiness probe fails if any Corda components report that they are down.
During worker startup, this is expected behaviour and all the components should eventually report
that they are up, resulting in the pod being marked as ready. Failures in the readiness probe after a worker
has started successfully are typically the result of issues with downstream services (for example, Kafka or Postgres).
These situations should be recoverable, but a Cluster Administrator should monitor for Kubernetes pods that are not marked
as ready as these will not be processing work. In regard to workers that expose HTTP endpoints (the REST and P2P Gateway workers),
Kubernetes will not route HTTP requests to a worker that is not ready.
