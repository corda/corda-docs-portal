# Setting the State of Virtual Nodes

A virtual node can have one of the following states:

* `ACTIVE` — normal operational mode.
* `MAINTENANCE` — maintenance mode. This mode disables all operational statuses:
    * `flowOperationalStatus` — a virtual node’s ability to start new flows.
    * `flowP2pOperationalStatus` — a virtual node’s ability to communicate with peers.
    * `flowStartOperationalStatus` — a virtual node’s ability to run flows, to have checkpoints, and to continue in-progress flows.
    * `vaultDbOperationalStatus` — a virtual node’s ability to perform persistence operations on the virtual node’s {{< tooltip >}}vault{{< /tooltip >}}.

    A virtual node in maintenance mode does not allow the starting or running of flows. Any activity for existing flows causes the flow to be killed and marked with a flow status of `KILLED`. Counterparty flows fail with an error message indicating that a peer is in maintenance. This state allows virtual node operators to have a static vault with which they can take backups before performing potentially destructive operations such as a virtual node upgrade for migrations. Changing a virtual node's state back to active requires that the virtual node has executed all migrations in the currently associated {{< tooltip >}}CPI{{< /tooltip >}}. This prevents a virtual node from becoming operational while migrations are in progress during a virtual node upgrade.

You can put an operational virtual node into maintenance mode, or return a node from maintenance to active mode, using the PUT method of the <a href ="../../reference/rest-api/C5_OpenAPI.html#tag/Virtual-Node-API/operation/put_virtualnode__virtualnodeshortid__state__newstate_">`api/v1/virtualnode/<virtualnodeshortid>/state/<newstate>` endpoint </a>:
