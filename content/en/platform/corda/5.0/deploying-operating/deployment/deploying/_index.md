# Deploying
This page describes how to deploy Corda 5. All the necessary [prerequisites]({{< relref "../prerequisites.md" >}}) must have been satisfied before Corda is deployed.
In particular, PostgreSQL and Kafka must be running. The mechanism to achieve that is up to you. For example, you can:

* run PostgreSQL and Kafka on Kubernetes.
* use a managed service such as Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL, Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka, or Confluent Cloud.

This section contains the following:
* [Download and Push Container Images to a Registry]({{< relref "#download-and-push-container-images-to-a-registry">}})
* [Download the Corda Helm Chart]({{< relref "#download-the-corda-helm-chart">}})
* [Configure the Deployment]({{< relref "#configure-the-deployment">}})
* [Deployment]({{< relref "#deployment">}})

## Download and Push Container Images to a Registry

The Corda container images must be in a registry that is accessible from the Kubernetes cluster in which Corda will run.
By default, the Corda Community images are made available via Docker Hub.
If your Kubernetes cluster can not pull images from Docker Hub, or if you are deploying Corda Enterprise, the following sections describe how to push the images from the provided `tar` file into a container registry that is accessible from the cluster:
* [Container Images for Corda Community]({{< relref "#container-images-for-corda-community" >}})
* [Container Images for Corda Enterprise]({{< relref "#container-images-for-corda-enterprise" >}})

### Container Images for Corda Community

To push the Corda Community images: 

1. Download `corda-os-worker-images-Iguana1.0.tar` from the [R3 Developer Portal](https://developer.r3.com/next-gen-corda/#get-corda).

2. Inflate and load the `corda-os-worker-images-Iguana1.0.tar` file into the local Docker engine with the following command:
   ```shell
   docker load -i corda-os-worker-images-Iguana1.0.tar
   ```

3. Retag each image using the name of the registry to be used and push the image. The following is an example script to automate this. It takes the target container registry as an argument. If the target registry requires authentication, you must perform a `docker login` against the registry before running the script.
   ```shell
   #!/bin/bash
   if [ -z "$1" ]; then
    echo "Specify target registry"
    exit 1
   fi

   declare -a images=(
    "corda-os-rest-worker" "corda-os-flow-worker"
    "corda-os-member-worker" "corda-os-p2p-gateway-worker"
    "corda-os-p2p-link-manager-worker" "corda-os-db-worker"
    "corda-os-crypto-worker" "corda-os-plugins" )
   tag=5.0.0.0-Iguana1.0
   target_registry=$1

   for image in "${images[@]}"; do
    source=corda/$image:$tag
    target=$target_registry/$image:$tag
    echo "Publishing image $source to $target"
    docker tag $source $target
    docker push $target
   done

   docker tag postgres:14.4 $target_registry/postgres:14.4
   docker push $target_registry/postgres:14.4
   ```

### Container Images for Corda Enterprise {{< enterprise-icon >}}

To push the Corda Enterprise images: 

1. Download `corda-ent-worker-images-Iguana1.0.tar` from the [R3 Customer Hub](https://r3.force.com/).

2. Inflate and load the `corda-ent-worker-images-Iguana1.0.tar` file into the local Docker engine with the following command:
   ```shell
   docker load -i corda-ent-worker-images-Iguana1.0.tar
   ```

3. Retag each image using the name of the registry to be used and push the image. The following is an example script to automate this. It takes the target container registry as an argument. If the target registry requires authentication, you must perform a `docker login` against the registry before running the script.
   ```shell
   #!/bin/bash
   if [ -z "$1" ]; then
    echo "Specify target registry"
    exit 1
   fi

   declare -a images=(
    "corda-ent-rest-worker" "corda-ent-flow-worker"
    "corda-ent-member-worker" "corda-ent-p2p-gateway-worker"
    "corda-ent-p2p-link-manager-worker" "corda-ent-db-worker"
    "corda-ent-crypto-worker" "corda-ent-plugins" )
   tag=5.0.0.0-Iguana1.0
   target_registry=$1

   for image in "${images[@]}"; do
    source=corda/$image:$tag
    target=$target_registry/$image:$tag
    echo "Publishing image $source to $target"
    docker tag $source $target
    docker push $target
   done

   docker tag postgres:14.4 $target_registry/postgres:14.4
   docker push $target_registry/postgres:14.4
   ```

## Download the Corda Helm Chart

The following sections describe how to download the Corda Helm chart:
* [Corda Community Helm chart]({{< relref "#corda-community-helm-chart" >}})
* [Corda Enterprise Helm chart]({{< relref "#corda-enterprise-helm-chart" >}})

### Corda Community Helm chart

If you have access to Docker Hub, you can download the Corda Community Helm chart using the following command:

```shell
helm fetch oci://registry-1.docker.io/corda/corda --version 5.0.0-Iguana1.0
```

If you do not have access to Docker Hub, you can download the `corda-5.0.0-Iguana1.0.tgz` file from the [R3 Developer Portal](https://developer.r3.com/next-gen-corda/#get-corda).

### Corda Enterprise Helm chart {{< enterprise-icon >}}

You can download the `corda-enterprise-5.0.0-Iguana1.0.tgz` file from the the [R3 Customer Hub](https://r3.force.com/).

## Configure the Deployment

For each deployment, you should create a YAML file to define a set of Helm overrides to be used for that environment.
The following sections describe the minimal set of configuration options required for a deployment:
* [Image Registry]({{< relref "#image-registry" >}})
* [Replica Counts]({{< relref "#replica-counts" >}})
* [Resource Requests and Limits]({{< relref "#resource-requests-and-limits" >}})
* [REST API]({{< relref "#rest-api" >}})
* [PostgreSQL]({{< relref "#postgresql" >}})
* [Encryption]({{< relref "#encryption" >}})
* [Bootstrapping]({{< relref "#bootstrapping" >}})
* [Custom Annotations for Worker Pods]({{< relref "#custom-annotations-for-worker-pods" >}})

You can extract a README containing the full set of options from the Helm chart using the following command:
```shell
helm show readme <HELM-CHART-TGZ-FILE>
```

You can extract a YAML file containing all of the default values using the following command:
```shell
helm show values <HELM-CHART-TGZ-FILE>
```

### Image Registry

If you are not using the Corda container images from Docker Hub, define an override specifying the name of the container registry to which you pushed the images:
```yaml
image:
  registry: <REGISTRY-NAME>
```

If the registry requires authentication, create a [Kubernetes secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#docker-config-secrets)
containing the container registry credentials, in the Kubernetes namespace where Corda is to be deployed. Specify an override with the name of the Kubernetes secret:
```yaml
imagePullSecrets:
  - <IMAGE-PULL-SECRET-NAME>
```

### Replica Counts

For high-availability, specify at least three replicas for each type of Corda worker:
```yaml
workers:
  crypto:
    replicaCount: 3
  db:
    replicaCount: 3
  flow:
    replicaCount: 3
  membership:
    replicaCount: 3
  rest:
    replicaCount: 3
  p2pGateway:
    replicaCount: 3
  p2pLinkManager:
    replicaCount: 3
```

{{< note >}}
Depending on your application workload, you may require additional replicas.
{{< /note >}}

### Resource Requests and Limits

Specify a default set of resource requests and limits for the Corda containers. The following are recommended as a starting point:
```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    memory: 512Mi
    cpu: 250m
  limits:
    memory: 512Mi
    cpu: 2000m
```
{{< note >}}
It is particularly important to specify resource requests when using a Kubernetes cluster with auto-scaling, to ensure that it scales appropriately when the Corda cluster is deployed.
{{< /note >}}

You can also override the default resource requests and limits separately for each type of Corda worker.
For example, we recommend starting with higher memory limits for the database and flow workers:
```yaml
workers:
  db:
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: 2048Mi
      limits:
        memory: 2048Mi
  flow:
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: 2048Mi
      limits:
        memory: 2048Mi
```
As with the number of replicas, you may need to adjust these values based on testing with your actual application workload.

#### Recommended Infrastructure

Regarding AWS topology, we recommend the following initial configuration:

* Kubernetes: For a cluster with a single replica of each worker, a Kubernetes cluster with two `t3.2xlarge` nodes is
  a reasonable starting point. For a cluster with three replicas of each worker, extend that to four nodes.

* RDS PostgreSQL: `db.r5.large` instance size is sufficient for both a Corda cluster with a single replica of each worker
  and three replicas of each worker, subject to the persistence requirements of any CorDapp running in the cluster.

* MSK: For a cluster with a single replica of each worker and a topic replica count of three, a Kafka cluster of three
  `kafka.t3.small` instances may suffice. In a HA topology with three replicas of each worker and a topic replica count
  of three, we recommend five brokers using at least `kafka.m5.large` instances.

### REST API

The following configuration options are available for the [REST API]({{< relref "../../../reference/rest-api/_index.md" >}}):
* [Expose the REST API]({{< relref "#expose-the-rest-api" >}})
* [Install the REST Worker Certificate]({{< relref "#install-the-rest-worker-certificate" >}})
#### Expose the REST API

By default, the REST API is exposed on an internal Kubernetes service.
To enable access from outside the Kubernetes cluster, use one of the following:

* [Kubernetes Ingress](#kubernetes-ingress)
* [AWS Load Balancer Controller](#aws-load-balancer-controller)

##### Kubernetes Ingress

We recommend configuring Kubernetes Ingress to provide the REST worker with HTTP load balancing.
This also enables optional annotations for additional integration, such as External DNS or Cert Manager. For example:
```yaml
workers:
  rest:
    ingress:
      # optional annotations for the REST worker ingress
      annotations: {}
      # optional className for the REST worker ingress
      className: "nginx"
      # required hosts for the REST worker ingress
      hosts:
      - <your-rest-worker.development.example.com>
```

##### AWS Load Balancer Controller

Alternatively, the API can be fronted directly by a load balancer. The Helm chart allows annotations to be specified to
facilitate the creation of a load balancer by a cloud-platform specific controller.
For example, the following configuration specifies that the [AWS Load Balancer Controller](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/aws-load-balancer-controller.html)
fronts the REST API with a Network Load Balancer internal to the Virtual Private Cloud (VPC):

```yaml
workers:
  rest:
    service:
      type: LoadBalancer
      annotations:
        service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-internal: true
        service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-scheme: internal
        service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-type: nlb
        external-dns.beta.kubernetes.io/hostname: corda.example.com
```

#### Install the REST Worker Certificate

The REST worker TLS certificate is presented to a client any time a HTTPS connection is made.
If no specific parameters are provided, a self-signed certificate is used and the connection to the REST Worker is always HTTPS. However, a warning will be emitted into the REST worker log explaining how to provide parameters for custom TLS certificates.
The following is required to install a valid TLS certificate:
* The TLS certificate itself must be signed by a Certification Authority (CA) or an intermediary.
* A private key corresponding to the public key included in the TLS certificate.
* The Certification Chain must lead up to the CA.

{{< note >}}
If you configure the REST worker to use a trusted certificate, `-k` should be removed from the example curl commands given throughout this documentation.
{{< /note >}}

Custom certificate information can be provided in PEM format as a Kubernetes secret. 
You can either create a Kubernetes secret manually to hold the certificate information or allow Helm to generate a new secret.
You can specify the secret name manually as follows:
```yaml
workers:
  rest:
     tls:
      secretName: <PEM_TLS_CERT_SECRET_NAME>
```
If this optional value is not provided, Helm generates the certificate data at installation time and automatically creates a Kubernetes secret for the REST worker to use.

{{< note >}}
If the secret data is modified, the REST worker pod will not currently detect the change until the pod is restarted.
{{</ note >}}

### PostgreSQL

The password for PostgreSQL can be specified directly as a Helm override, but this is not recommended.
Instead, create a Kubernetes secret containing the password with a key of `password`. By default, the installation
expects a database called `cordacluster`, but this can be overridden. You can then define the PostgreSQL configuration as follows:

```yaml
db:
  cluster:
    host: <POSTGRESQL_HOST>
    port: 5432
    username:
      value: <POSTGRESQL_USER>
    password:
      valueFrom:
        secretKeyRef:
          name: <POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD_SECRET_NAME>
          key: <POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD_SECRET_KEY>
    database: <POSTGRESQL_CLUSTER_DB>
```

### Kafka

Specify the Kafka bootstrap servers as a comma-separated list:
```yaml
kafka:
  bootstrapServers: <KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS>
```
If desired, a prefix can be applied to all of the Kafka topics used by the Corda deployment. This enables multiple Corda clusters to share a Kafka cluster. For example:
```yaml
kafka:
  topicPrefix: <KAFKA_TOPIC_PREFIX>
```
Enable TLS if required by the Kafka client protocol:
```yaml
kafka:
  tls:
    enabled: true
```

If the broker certificate is self-signed or cannot be trusted for some other reason, create a Kubernetes secret containing the client trust store. The trust store can be in PEM or JKS format. If JKS format is used, you can supply a password for the trust store. The following example is for a trust store in PEM format stored against the `ca.crt` key in the Kubernetes secret:
```yaml
kafka
  tls:
    secretRef:
      name: <TRUST-STORE-SECRET-NAME>
      key: "ca.crt"
    type: PEM
```

Corda supports SASL for Kafka authentication. If your Kafka instance requires SASL authentication, enable the option in the overrides along with the required mechanism:

```yaml
kafka:
  sasl:
    enabled: true
    mechanism: "SCRAM-SHA-512"
```

A single set of credentials can be specified for use everywhere by reference to a Kubernetes secret containing the username and password:

```yaml
kafka:
  sasl:
    username:
      valueFrom:
        secretKeyRef:
          name: <SASL-SECRET-NAME>
          key: "username"
    password:
      valueFrom:
        secretKeyRef:
          name: <SASL-SECRET-NAME>
          key: "password"
```

Alternatively, for finer-grained access control, separate credentials can be specified for bootstrapping, and for each type of worker. For example:

```yaml
bootstrap:
  kafka:
    sasl:
      username:
        valueFrom:
          secretKeyRef:
            name: <SASL-SECRET-NAME>
            key: "bootstrap-username"
      password:
        valueFrom:
          secretKeyRef:
            name: <SASL-SECRET-NAME>
            key: "bootstrap-password"
workers:
  crypto:
    kafka:
      sasl:
        username:
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: <SASL-SECRET-NAME>
              key: "crypto-username"
        password:
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: <SASL-SECRET-NAME>
              key: "crypto-password"
```

Note that, here, as elsewhere, credentials can also be specified directly as part of the overrides using `value` instead of `valueFrom`.
For example:

```yaml
username:
  value: <USERNAME>
```

### Encryption

The Corda configuration system allows for any string configuration value to be marked as “secret”. This includes values passed dynamically using the REST API and also those defined in a manual deployment configuration. For more information see, [Configuration Secrets]({{< relref "../../config/secrets.md" >}}).

#### Default Secrets Service

The [Corda default secrets lookup service]({{< relref "../../config/secrets.md#default-secrets-service" >}}) uses a salt and passphrase specified in the deployment configuration. Specify these as follows:

```yaml
config:
   encryption:
      salt:
        valueFrom:
          secretKeyRef:
            name: <SALT_SECRET_NAME>
            key: <SALT_SECRET_KEY>
      passphrase: 
        valueFrom:
          secretKeyRef:
            name: <PASSPHRASE_SECRET_NAME>
            key: <PASSPHRASE_SECRET_KEY>
```

#### External Secrets Service {{< enterprise-icon >}}

To configure Corda Enterprise to connect to a running [HashiCorp Vault instance]({{< relref "../../config/secrets.md#external-secrets-service" >}}), add the following:

```yaml
config:
  vault:
    url: "<vault-URL>"
    token: "<vault-token>"
    createdSecretPath: "<path-to-corda-created-secrets>"
```

* `<vault-URL>` is the full URL including port at which the Vault instance is reachable, not including any path.
* `<vault-token>` must allow sufficient permissions to read from Vault at the Corda configured paths and write to the `<path-to-corda-created-secrets>`, where Corda writes secrets it creates.

The passwords for the RBAC and CRYPTO schemas and VNODES database must be available in Vault before Corda is deployed. These must be available in the Vault `dbsecrets` path, under the keys `rbac`, `crypto`, and `vnodes` respectively. 
{{< note >}}
These keys are not tied to the schema names. If the schema names change, the key names remain `rbac`, `crypto`, and `vnodes`.
{{< /note >}}
Additionally, a passphrase and salt for the Corda wrapping keys must be added to the Vault `cryptosecrets` path under the keys `passphrase` and `salt` respectively.

### Bootstrapping

By default, the Helm chart automatically configures Kafka, PostgreSQL, and a default set of Corda RBAC roles as part of the deployment process.
If desired, each of these steps can be disabled and the necessary [configuration performed manually]({{< relref "manual-bootstrapping.md" >}}).

{{< note >}}
Bootstrap secrets are cleaned up automatically post-install with the exception of the `-rest-api-admin` secret. This secret should be manually deleted by the Administrator after retrieving the generated credentials. 
{{< /note >}}

#### Kafka
The Kafka bootstrapping creates the topics required by Corda.
If `kafka.topicPrefix` has been specified, the process uses this as a prefix for all of the topic names.
The bootstrap configuration enables the default number of topic partitions to be overridden.
You may need to increase this to support a larger number of Corda worker replicas.
It is also possible to override the default topic replica count; for example, if less than three Kafka brokers are available.
The following extract shows the default values:

```yaml
bootstrap:
  kafka:
    enabled: true
    partitions: 10
    replicas: 3
```

If SASL authentication is enabled, the bootstrapping also creates Access Control List (ACL) entries for producing and
consuming from the topics as appropriate for each worker.

#### Database

The database bootstrapping creates schemas in the cluster database and populates them with the initial configuration. It is enabled by default:

```yaml
bootstrap:
  db:
    enabled: true
```
By default, the database bootstrapping uses the psql CLI from the Docker image `postgres:14.4` on Docker Hub.
If the Kubernetes cluster does not have access to Docker Hub, you must make this image available in an internal registry.
You can then specify the location of the image via overrides, as follows:

```yaml
db:
  clientImage:
    registry: <REGISTRY>
    repository: "postgres"
    tag: "14.4"
```
Part of the database bootstrapping involves populating the initial credentials for the REST API admin. You can specify these in one of the following ways:

* Pass the user name and password as Helm values:
  ```yaml
  bootstrap:
    restApiAdmin:
      username:
        value: <USERNAME>
      password:
        value: <PASSWORD>
  ```

* Leave the password field blank. A Kubernetes secret is created containing a generated password. The notes output
when the deployment completes contain instructions for how to retrieve this. This is the default behavior.

* Create a Kubernetes secret containing the user credentials:
  ```yaml
  bootstrap:
    restApiAdmin:
      username:
        valueFrom:
          secretKeyRef:
            name: <INITIAL_ADMIN_USER_SECRET_NAME>
            key: "username"
      password:
        valueFrom:
          secretKeyRef:
            name: <INITIAL_ADMIN_USER_SECRET_NAME>
            key: "password"
  ```

* By default, there is a single database user used for both the bootstrap process and, subsequently at runtime, by the crypto and DB workers.
R3 recommends configuring separate bootstrap and runtime users, by specifying a bootstrap user as follows:

   ```yaml
   bootstrap:
     db:
       cluster:
         username:
           value: <POSTGRESQL_BOOTSTRAP_USER>
         password:
           valueFrom:
             secretKeyRef:
               name: <POSTGRESQL_BOOTSTRAP_PASSWORD_SECRET_NAME>
               key: <POSTGRESQL_BOOTSTRAP_PASSWORD_SECRET_KEY>
   ```

#### RBAC

The RBAC bootstrapping creates three default RBAC roles. It is enabled by default:
```yaml
bootstrap:
  rbac:
    enabled: true
```

### Service Accounts

If additional permissions are required, you can specify a service account for the Corda workers and bootstrap containers.

For example, when running with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, you must use a service account with the priviliged security context constraint:

1. Create a file `sa.yaml` defining a custom service account bound to a role that provides the required security context constraint:

   ```yaml
   kind: ServiceAccount
   apiVersion: v1
   metadata:
     name: corda-privileged

   kind: Role
   apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
   metadata:
     name: corda-privileged
   rules:
     - verbs:
         - use
       apiGroups:
         - security.openshift.io
       resources:
         - securitycontextconstraints
       resourceNames:
         - privileged

   kind: RoleBinding
   apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
   metadata:
     name: corda-privileged
   subjects:
     - kind: ServiceAccount
       name: corda-privileged
   roleRef:
     apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
     kind: Role
     name: corda-privileged
   ```

2. Create the service account, role, and role binding in the namespace where Corda is to be deployed:

   ```shell
   kubectl apply -f sa.yaml
   ```

3. In the configuration YAML for the Corda deployment, specify the service account to be used:

   ```yaml
   serviceAccount: "corda-privileged"
   bootstrap:
     serviceAccount: "corda-privileged"
   ```

### Custom Annotations for Worker Pods

You can define custom annotations for worker pods. You can add these globally or to individual workers. For example, to define `annotation-key-1` for all workers:

```yaml
annotations:
  annotation-key-1: "custom-value"
```

To define `annotation-key-2` for only the crypto worker:

```yaml
workers:
  crypto:
    annotations:
      annotation-key-2: "some-value"
```

### Example Configuration

{{< warning >}}
The example in this section is included only for illustrative purposes. You must use the information provided to determine
the correct configuration file for your environment.
{{< /warning >}}

The following example shows a complete configuration file for Corda deployment in an environment in which Kafka is using
a trusted TLS certificate, SASL authentication is enabled, the REST API is exposed via an AWS Network Load Balancer,
and the generated password for the initial admin user is retrieved from a secret.

```yaml
image:
  registry: "registry.example.com"

imagePullSecrets:
  - "registry-secret"

resources:
  requests:
    memory: 512Mi
    cpu: 250m
  limits:
    memory: 512Mi
    cpu: 2000m

serviceAccount: "corda-privileged"

db:
  cluster:
    host: "postgres.example.com"
    port: 5432
    database: "cordacluster"
    user:

    password:
      valueFrom:
        secretKeyRef:
          name: "postgres-secret"
          key: "password"

kafka:

## Deployment

Once the configuration for the environment has been defined in a YAML file, you can install the Helm chart:
```shell
helm install -n <NAMESPACE> <HELM-RELEASE-NAME> <HELM-CHART-TGZ-FILE> -f <PATH-TO-YAML-FILE>
```
For example, to create a Helm release called `corda` in the `corda` namespace using the overrides specified in a file called `values.yaml`, run the following:

```shell
helm install -n corda corda <HELM-CHART-TGZ-FILE> -f values.yaml
```

If you are using the Helm chart from Docker Hub, you can install directly from there rather than using `helm fetch` first. For example:

```shell
helm install -n corda corda oci://corda-os-docker.software.r3.com/helm-charts/release-5.0.0.0-iguana1.0/corda --version 5.0.0-Iguana1.0 -f values.yaml
```

{{< enterprise-icon noMargin="true" >}}Alternatively, use the following command for Corda Enterprise:
```shell
helm install -n corda corda oci://corda-ent-docker.software.r3.com/helm-charts/release-5.0.0.0-iguana1.0/corda-enterprise --version 5.0.0-Iguana1.0 -f values.yaml
```

Once the Helm install completes, all of the Corda workers are ready. A message is output containing instructions on how
to access the [Corda REST API]({{< relref "../../../reference/rest-api/_index.md" >}}).
If the Helm install fails, see the troubleshooting section on [observability]({{< relref "../../observability/_index.md" >}}).
