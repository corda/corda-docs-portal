# Distributed Ledger Technology

As described in the [Privacy Key Concepts section]({{< relref "../privacy/_index.md">}}), Corda offers a single, global, source of truth that can be shared by multiple untrusting individuals. 
Corda provides this utilizing a distributed ledger.
DLT has the following characteristics:
* A distributed ledger is a database of facts that are replicated, shared, and synchronized across multiple participants on a network.
* Participants are known as identities and represent a real-world {{< tooltip >}}entity{{< /tooltip >}} within the context of an {{< tooltip >}}application network{{< /tooltip >}}.
* Each identity has a different view of the ledger, depending on the facts it shares.
* Identities that share a fact must reach a consensus before it is committed to the ledger.
* All identities always see the exact same version of any on-ledger facts they share.
