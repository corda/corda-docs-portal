# Virtual Nodes

As of Corda 5, a single Corda deployment can host multiple virtual node identities. In previous versions, the identity and the compute process/JVM were tied. Hence in this version of Corda, we refer to virtual nodes, rather than nodes. They are now a context in which a distributed application runs, rather than the process itself.

We now also refer to application networks, as networks of virtual nodes that all run the same, or compatible, {{< tooltip >}}CorDapps{{< /tooltip >}} and where membership of the network is managed by the {{< tooltip >}}MGM{{< /tooltip >}}. In other words, a virtual node represents an identity on a network of application users that is managed by the MGM.

A virtual node is abstracted from the Corda runtime, and so a Corda cluster can support many virtual node members of different networks. However, a given virtual node can only belong to a single application network, and can only be deployed to a single Corda cluster at one time. An application network can span multiple Corda clusters.

Virtual nodes are identified by their {{< tooltip >}}X.500{{< /tooltip >}} name and the ID of the network they belong to. This means that the same X.500 name (for example, the same legal {{< tooltip >}}entity{{< /tooltip >}}), can exist on multiple networks at the same time.

For information about managing virtual nodes using the REST API, see [Managing Virtual Nodes]({{< relref "../../../deploying-operating/vnodes/_index.md" >}}).
