The `membership` package provides services for working with membership groups. The <a href="../../../../../../api-ref/corda/5.0-beta/java/net/corda/v5/application/membership/MemberLookup.html" target="_blank">`MemberLookup`</a> service allows a flow to discover what counterparties are available in the membership group or retrieve full details of a counterparty with a given name.

For information about other services that you can use to retrieve information about a member, see the [membership module]({{< relref "../api-membership.md" >}}).
