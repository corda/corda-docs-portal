The [CSDE environment](https://github.com/corda/CSDE-cordapp-template-kotlin) is intended to make developing a CorDapp a seamless experience for CorDapp developers. This has been enhanced for the Corda 5.0 Beta 1 release to automatically deploy a notary virtual node to the network which supports the non-validating notary protocol, and will also package the necessary client CPKs with the CSDE CorDapp.


For more information on CSDE in Corda 5.0, see the CorDapp Standard Development Environment (CSDE) section.
