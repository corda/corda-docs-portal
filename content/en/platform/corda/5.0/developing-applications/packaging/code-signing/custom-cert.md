# Signing Packages with a Custom Certificate

As described in [Build a CPB]({{< relref "../cpb.md" >}}) and [Build a CPK]({{< relref "../cpk.md" >}}), the Gradle plugin uses, by default,
a development certificate to sign a CPB or CPK package.

However, you can configure the plugin to use a custom certificate using the `cordapp signing` section of the Gradle plugin:

{{< note >}}
When a custom certificate is used, it will need to be uploaded to the cluster using the
[/api/v1/certificates/cluster/code-signer API endpoint](../../../reference/rest-api/C5_OpenAPI.html#tag/Certificates-API/operation/put_certificates_cluster__usage_).
For example:
`curl -k -u admin:admin -X PUT -F alias="your-key" -F certificate=@your-key.pem https://localhost:8888/api/v1/certificates/cluster/code-signer`

```
