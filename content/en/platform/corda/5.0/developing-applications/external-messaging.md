# External Messaging CorDapps {{< enterprise-icon >}}
A running Corda flow can send simple messages via Kafka to external systems. 
In Corda 5.0, this is limited to sending messages, but a future version will support both send and send-and-receive messages. 

External messaging is implemented in CorDapps by the following components:
* **Channels** - abstract representations of routes from a flow to an external system. They allow Cluster Administrators and Network Operators to control the Kafka implementation of a logical channel at the cluster and virtual node level. A CorDapp Developer is responsible for defining the channels as part of the CorDapp.
* **Routes** - configuration of the channel and its behavior for a specific virtual node. This includes the actual Kafka topic to be used, if the route is active or not, and how the flow API responds to an inactive route.
* **Default Route Configuration** - the route configuration used, along with any channels defined in the CorDapp, to generate the virtual nodeâ€™s routes. The default route configuration is defined at the cluster level and can be updated via the <a href="../reference/rest-api/C5_OpenAPI.html#tag/Configuration-API/operation/put_config">`config` endpoint</a> of the REST API. For more information see [Configuring External Messaging]({{< relref "../deploying-operating/external-messaging/_index.md">}}).
* **Flow API** - an injectable flow service allows the flow to send messages via a named and configured channel to external systems. 

To create a CorDapp that can use external messaging, you must add a resource file to define the channel(s) to use and inject the external messaging API service into the flow: 

1. To define the channel(s) to use:

   Create a JSON configuration file, `external-channels.json`, in `resources\config\` and define a list of the named channels and their type. For example:
   ```json
   {
     "channels": [
       {
         "name": "external_app",
         "type": "SEND"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```
   {{< note >}}
   * Both the `name` and `type` fields are mandatory.
   * In this version, `type` must be set to `SEND`.
   * Names can contain alphanumeric values, underscores, periods, and dashes and must have between 1 and 100 characters. Topic names with a period or underscore could clash in internal data structures, so we recommend that you use either but not both.

2. Add the API service using `@CordaInject`. The following example flow shows how the API is injected and how the API can be called, sending a simple string message to the defined channel `external_app`:  

   {{< note >}}
   Channel names are case sensitive.
   {{< /note >}}

   ```java
   class ExternalMessageTestFlow : ClientStartableFlow {
   
       private companion object {
           val log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(this::class.java.enclosingClass)
       }

       @CordaInject
       lateinit var externalMessaging: ExternalMessaging

       @Suspendable
       override fun call(requestBody: ClientRequestBody): String {
           log.info("Starting Test Flow...")
           try {
               externalMessaging.send("external_app", "hello outside world!")

               return ""

           } catch (e: Exception) {
               log.error("Unexpected error while processing the flow", e)
               throw e
           }
       }
   }
   ``` 

   Once your CorDapp has been [packaged]({{< relref "./packaging/_index.md">}}), the Network Operator can [create a virtual node]({{< relref "../application-networks/creating/members/cpi.md">}}) to run the CorDapp. Corda creates routes for the virtual node as part of the virtual node creation process.  The Cluster Administrator must manually [create the required Kafka topics]({{< relref "../deploying-operating/external-messaging/_index.md#creating-kafka-topics">}}) and can also optionally [change the default route configuration]({{< relref "../deploying-operating/external-messaging/_index.md#configuring-external-messaging-routes">}}).
