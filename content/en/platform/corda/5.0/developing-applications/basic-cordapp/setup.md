# Initial Setup

After you have completed this tutorial, you will have modified the CSDE environment to make it ready for building your CorDapp.
You will have also created three packages within the existing CSDE project structure.

{{< note >}}
The packages are not required but they define a suggested structure for you to follow.
{{< /note >}}

## Initial Setup of Your CorDapp

In this tutorial, you will use the CSDE repository as a template and build on top of it.
This project already contains some example flows, contracts, and states.

1. Clone or fork the [CSDE repository](https://github.com/corda/CSDE-cordapp-template-kotlin).

2. Read the CSDE [installation instructions]({{< relref "../getting-started/installing/_index.md" >}}) and repeat the steps relevant to your CorDapp.

3. Update the `workflows` module by performing the following steps:

   a. Update the CorDapp's configuration in the `workflows` module `build.gradle` file to reflect the purpose of your CorDapp:

   ```kotlin
    workflow {
    name "Apples utxo example workflow"
    versionId 1
    vendor "VendorNameHere"
    }
    ```

   b. Create the `com.r3.developers.apples.workflows` package. If using IntelliJ, you can do this by right-clicking
the **kotlin** folder within the **workflows** folder and then selecting **New > Package**.

4. Update the `contracts` module by performing the following steps:

   a. Update the CorDapp's configuration in the `contracts` module `build.gradle` file to reflect the purpose of your CorDapp:
   ```kotlin
    contract {
    name "Apples utxo example contract"
    versionId 1
    vendor "VendorNameHere"
    }
    ```

   b. Create two packages:

   * com.r3.developers.apples.contracts
   * com.r3.developers.apples.states
