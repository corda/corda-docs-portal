This section describes how to configure the MGM, through which a membership group is created for a dynamic network. The sections must be completed in the order in which they are presented:

1. [Build the MGM CPI]({{< relref "./cpi.md">}}).
2. [Create a virtual node]({{< relref "./virtual-node.md">}}).
3. [Configure key pairs and certificates]({{< relref "./key-pairs.md">}}).
4. [Register the MGM]({{< relref "./register.md">}}).
5. [Configure communication properties]({{< relref "./config-node.md">}}).

These sections describe a standard configuration. You can read about alternative configurations in the [Optional Configurations]({{< relref"../optional/_index.md">}}) section.

{{< note >}}
These tutorials all assume that you have:
<!--* [deployed Corda 5 to a Kubernetes cluster]()).-->
