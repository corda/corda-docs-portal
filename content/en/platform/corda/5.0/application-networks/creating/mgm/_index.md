These sections describe a standard configuration. You can read about alternative configurations in the [Optional Configurations]({{< relref"../optional/_index.md">}}) section.

These tutorials all assume that you have:
* [deployed Corda 5 to a Kubernetes cluster](../../../deploying-operating/deployment/deploying/_index.md).
* cloned the [GitHub corda-runtime-os repository](https://github.com/corda/corda-runtime-os).

The PowerShell commands listed are for use with PowerShell 7.0 and will not execute correctly with PowerShell 5.x.
