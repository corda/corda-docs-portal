# Create a Virtual Node
You can create a virtual node using the POST method of the [/api/v1/virtualnode endpoint](../../../reference/rest-api/C5_OpenAPI.html#tag/Virtual-Node-API/operation/post_virtualnode). The following sections describe how to use this method:
* [Create a Virtual Node on Linux or macOS](#create-a-virtual-node-on-linux-or-macos)
* [Create a Virtual Node on Windows](#create-a-virtual-node-on-windows)

## Create a Virtual Node on Linux or macOS

To create a virtual node for a member on Linux or macOS, run the following commands in Bash to send the request using Curl, changing the X.500 name and using the checksum retrieved when you [uploaded the member CPI]({{< relref"./cpi.md#upload-the-cpi" >}}):

```shell
export CPI_CHECKSUM=<CPI-checksum>
export X500_NAME="C=GB, L=London, O=Alice"
curl -k -u $REST_API_USER:$REST_API_PASSWORD -d '{"request": {"cpiFileChecksum": "'$CPI_CHECKSUM'", "x500Name": "'$X500_NAME'"}}' $REST_API_URL/virtualnode
```

Check that the virtual node was created successfully by running the following, replacing `<request-ID>` with the ID returned in the received response:

```shell
curl -k -u $REST_API_USER:$REST_API_PASSWORD -X GET $REST_API_URL/virtualnode/status/<request-ID>
```

This request returns a JSON object with `status` set to `SUCCEEDED` once the operation is complete. You may have to call the `/virtualnode/status` endpoint multiple times until you receive the `SUCCEEDED` status. Once complete, to save the ID of the virtual node for future use, run the following command, replacing `<resource-ID>` with the ID returned in the received response:

```shell
export HOLDING_ID = <resource-ID>
```

## Create a Virtual Node on Windows

To create a virtual node for a member on Windows, run the following commands in PowerShell, changing the X.500 name. The command uses the checksum of the CPI from the response saved when you [uploaded the member CPI]({{< relref"./cpi.md#upload-the-cpi" >}}):

```shell
$X500_NAME = "C=GB, L=London, O=Alice"
$VIRTUAL_NODE_RESPONSE = Invoke-RestMethod -SkipCertificateCheck  -Headers @{Authorization=("Basic {0}" -f $AUTH_INFO)} -Uri "$REST_API_URL/virtualnode" -Method Post -Body (ConvertTo-Json @{
    request = @{
       cpiFileChecksum = $CPI_STATUS_RESPONSE.cpiFileChecksum
       x500Name = $X500_NAME
    }
})
```
Check that the virtual node was created successfully by running the following:

```shell
$VIRTUAL_NODE_RESPONSE_STATUS = Invoke-RestMethod -SkipCertificateCheck  -Headers @{Authorization=("Basic {0}" -f $AUTH_INFO)} -Uri "$REST_API_URL/virtualnode/status/$($VIRTUAL_NODE_RESPONSE.requestId)" -Method Get
```

This request returns a JSON object with `status` set to `SUCCEEDED` once the operation is complete. You may have to call the `/virtualnode/status` endpoint multiple times until you receive the `SUCCEEDED` status. Once complete, to save the ID of the virtual node for future use, run the following command:

```shell
$HOLDING_ID = $VIRTUAL_NODE_RESPONSE_STATUS.resourceId
```
