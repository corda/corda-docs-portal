This section describes how to create a dynamic network. The network requires a running Membership Group Manager (MGM) that all members must register with before they can transact among the group. This section also describes how to onboard a new member as a notary service representative. 

The main sections describe a standard configuration but you can learn more about using mutual TLS or session certificates in the _Optional Configurations_ section.
