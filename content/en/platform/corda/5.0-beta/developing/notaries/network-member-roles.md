# Network Member Roles

With the introduction of the UTXO ledger and notaries, network operators must be aware of the different roles that exist on a network. As of Beta 1, network participants can take one of three roles:

* **Application:** Members which run a CPI (Corda Package Installer) containing a CPB (Corda Package Bundle) which provides a CorDapp to run on the network. Most members fulfil this role, and would be our archetypical “Alice” or “Bob” nodes.

* **Notary:** Members which run a CPI containing a CPB which provide a notarization service to the network. These are effectively representatives of a notary service, similar to how notary workers represented a notary service in a Corda 4 high-availability notary setup.

* **MGM:** The Membership Group Manager. In the context of notaries, this special role can be ignored as the deployment of a MGM virtual node is handled transparently by our deployments.
