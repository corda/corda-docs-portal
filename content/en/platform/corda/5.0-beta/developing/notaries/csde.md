# CSDE Environment

The [CSDE environment](https://github.com/corda/CSDE-cordapp-template-kotlin) is intended to make developing a CorDapp a seamless experience for CorDapp developers. This has been enhanced for the Corda 5.0 Beta 1 release to automatically deploy a notary virtual node to the network which supports the non-validating notary protocol, and will also package the necessary client CPKs with the CSDE CorDapp.


For more information on CSDE in Corda 5.0, see the [CorDapp Standard Development Environment (CSDE)](../getting-started/cordapp-standard-development-environment/csde.md) section.
