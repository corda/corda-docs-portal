{{< note >}}
As of Beta 1.1, Simulator does not support the `UTXOLedgerService`. For now, this limits the usefulness of Simulator for UTXO-based applications.
{{< /note >}}

When writing any application, including CorDapps, it is helpful to have a fast feedback loop: code > test > debug > modify.
This accelerates the development process.
Although it is possible to develop directly against a Corda cluster (as described in [Running your first CorDapp](../running-your-first-cordapp/run-first-cordapp.html)), to deploy a CorDapp onto a Corda cluster is time-consuming, and unit testing by manually hitting endpoints is clumsy.

To make the development process much easier, R3 have developed **Simulator**.
Simulator is a lightweight testing and demo tool that simulates a Corda 5 network, enabling you to run CorDapps, demonstrate realistic behaviour, and receive feedback on how the CorDapp is likely to behave with a real Corda network.
Importantly, it is not a "light" version of Corda. There is no Corda code running under the hood.
Think of it as a framework for executing flow code that injects simulated Corda services into the flows at the same point that Corda would inject the real services.
Simulator runs in-process so it is easy to set breakpoints in the code and use it for debugging.
{{< note >}}
As Simulator is not executing Corda code, the error messages are likely to be different from Corda. While the intention is to simulate all of the Corda API, there may be small differences.

## Using Simulator

Simulator is designed to be used within a normal Java or Kotlin testing framework. This documentation describes using JUnit. [MyFirstFlow](../first-flow/first-flow.html) has a corresponding test class `MyFirstFlowTest` that demonstrates how to use Simulator. This file is in `/src/test/kotlin/com.r3.developers.csdetemplate.flowexample.workflows.MyFirstFlowTest.kt` or `/src/test/java/com.r3.developers.csdetemplate.flowexample.workflows.MyFirstFlowTest.java` in the [CSDE](../cordapp-standard-development-environment/csde.html) template repository.

To run the test, click the green triangle next to the test method and select **Run 'MyFirstFlowTestâ€¦'**:
{{< figure src="run-test.png" width="50%" figcaption="Run MyFirstFlowTest" alt="Command to run MyFirstFlowTest in IntelliJ" >}}

Alternatively, if you have multiple tests in the class, you can click the double triangle next to the class declaration to run all of the tests in the class.

The output should look as follows:
{{< figure src="test-result.png" figcaption="MyFirstFlowTest result" >}}
Note the green tick on the left indicating that the test was successful. You can also see various log messages from the code logged to the console.

## MyFirstFlowTest Code Overview

This section contains the full listing of `MyFirstFlowTest` with explanatory comments. The following sections describe the code in more detail:
