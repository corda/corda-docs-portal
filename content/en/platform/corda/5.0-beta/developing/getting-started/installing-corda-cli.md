title: Installing the Corda CLI
---

Corda CLI (command line interface) is a command line tool that supports various Corda-related tasks, including [Corda Package Installer (CPI)](../../introduction/key-concepts.html#corda-package-installer-cpi) creation and Corda cluster management.
The CorDapp Standard Development Environment (CSDE) uses Corda CLI in the background. As a result, you must install Corda CLI before using CSDE.

{{< note >}}
Performing command line instructions directly is described in the relevant sections throughout the documentation. The [Corda CLI Reference]({{< relref "../../corda-cli-reference/overview.md" >}}) lists all of the CLI commands.

## Downloading Corda CLI

To obtain the Corda CLI installer from the release pack on Customer Hub:
1. Download `platform-jars-Gecko.tar.gz` from the [R3 Customer Hub](https://r3.force.com/) or from the [R3 S3 repository](https://download.corda.net/packages/corda-cli-downloader/5.0.0.0-Gecko1.0/corda-cli-downloader-5.0.0.0-Gecko1.0.zip).
2. Extract `corda-cli-installer-5.0.0.0-Gecko2.0.zip` from `net\corda\cli\deployment\corda-cli-installer\5.0.0.0-Gecko2.0`.


## Installing on Linux/macOS

1. Ensure that you remove any existing installations of Corda CLI by deleting the `<user-home>/.corda/cli` folder.
2. Start a shell session (bash or zsh).
2. Change directory to where you saved `corda-cli-installer-5.0.0.0-Gecko.zip`.
3. Extract the contents of the `zip` file:
   ```shell
   unzip ./corda-cli-installer-5.0.0.0-Gecko.zip -d corda-cli-installer-5.0.0.0-Gecko
   ```
4. Change directory to the directory extracted from the `zip` file:
   ```shell
   cd corda-cli-installer-5.0.0.0-Gecko2.0
   ```
5. Run the install script:
   ```shell
   ./install.sh
   ```
   The script installs Corda CLI to `<user-home>/.corda/cli`, where `<user-home>` refers to your user home directory. For example, on macOS, this is typically something like `/Users/charlie.smith` or on Linux, something like `/home/charlie.smith`.

6. Run the following command to verify your installation:
   ```shell
   ./corda-cli.sh -h
   ```
   If successful, this outputs details of the Corda CLI commands.

## Installing on Windows

1. Ensure that you remove any existing installations of Corda CLI by deleting the `<user-home>/.corda/cli` folder.
2. Start a Powershell session.
2. Change directory to where you saved `corda-cli-installer-5.0.0.0--Gecko.zip`.
3. Extract the contents of the `zip` file:
   ```shell
   Expand-Archive .\corda-cli-installer-5.0.0.0-Gecko2.0.zip
   ```
4. Change directory to the directory extracted from the `zip` file:
   ```shell
   cd corda-cli-installer-5.0.0.0-Gecko2.0
   ```
5. Run the install script:
   ```shell
   .\install.ps1
   ```
   The script installs Corda CLI to `<user-home>/.corda/cli`, where `<user-home>` refers to your user home directory. On Windows, this is typically something like `C:\Users\Charlie.Smith`.

   {{< note >}}
   If your PowerShell execution policy does not allow you to run this script, copy the contents to your own PowerShell script and execute that instead.
