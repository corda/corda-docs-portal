The `membership` package provides services for working with membership groups. The <a href="../../../../../../api-ref/corda/5.0-beta/kotlin/application/net.corda.v5.application.membership/-member-lookup/index.html" target="_blank">`MemberLookup`</a> service allows a flow to discover what counterparties are available in the membership group or retrieve full details of a counterparty with a given name.

For information about other services that you can use to retrieve information about a member, see the <a href="{{< relref "../api-membership.md" >}})>`membership` module</a>.
