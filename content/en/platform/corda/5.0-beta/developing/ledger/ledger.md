A distributed ledger is a database of facts thatâ€™s replicated, shared, and synchronized across multiple participants on a network. 
Participants are members in the same [application network](../../introduction/key-concepts.html#application-networks), represented by [virtual nodes](../../introduction/key-concepts.html#virtual-nodes), and each participant's copy of the ledger is held in their [vault](**). Each participant has a different view of the ledger, depending on the facts it shares. Participants who share a fact must reach consensus before it is committed to the ledger. Two participants always see the exact same version of any on-ledger facts that they share.
