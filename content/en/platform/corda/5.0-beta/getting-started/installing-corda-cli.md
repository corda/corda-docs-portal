title: Installing the Corda CLI
---
Corda CLI (command line interface) is a command line tool that supports various Corda related tasks, including [Corda Package Installer (CPI)](../introduction/key-concepts.html#corda-package-installer-cpi) creation and Corda cluster management.
Direct use of Corda CLI by Developers is not in scope for Developer Preview 2. However, the [CorDapp Standard Development Environment (CSDE)](../getting-started/cordapp-standard-development-environment/csde.html) uses Corda CLI in the background.
As a result, you must install Corda CLI before using CSDE.

## Downloading Corda CLI
To install Corda CLI, download the installation `zip` file from https://download.corda.net/packages/corda-cli-downloader/5.0.0.0-DevPreview-2/corda-cli-downloader-5.0.0.0-DevPreview-2.zip.

## Installing on Linux/macOS

1. Start a shell session (bash or zsh).
2. Change directory to where you downloaded `corda-cli-downloader-5.0.0.0-DevPreview-2.zip`.
3. Extract the contents of the `zip` file:
   ```shell
   unzip ./corda-cli-downloader-5.0.0.0-DevPreview-2.zip -d corda-cli-downloader-5.0.0.0-DevPreview-2
   ```
4. Change directory to the directory extracted from the `zip` file:
   ```shell
   cd corda-cli-downloader-5.0.0.0-DevPreview-2
   ```
5. Run the install script:
   ```shell
   ./install.sh
   ```
   The script installs Corda CLI to `<user-home>/.corda/cli`, where `<user-home>` refers to your user home directory. For example, on macOS, this is typically something like `/Users/charlie.smith` or on Linux, something like `/home/charlie.smith`.

## Installing on Windows

1. Start a Powershell session.
2. Change directory to where you downloaded `corda-cli-downloader-5.0.0.0-DevPreview-2.zip`.
3. Extract the contents of the `zip` file:
   ```shell
   Expand-archive .\corda-cli-downloader-5.0.0.0-DevPreview-2.zip
   ```
4. Change directory to the directory extracted from the `zip` file:
   ```shell
   cd corda-cli-downloader-5.0.0.0-DevPreview-2
   ```
5. Run the install script:
   ```shell
   .\install.ps1
   ```
   The script installs Corda CLI to `<user-home>/.corda/cli`, where `<user-home>` refers to your user home directory. On Windows, this is typically something like `C:\Users\Charlie.Smith`.

   {{< note >}}
   If your PowerShell execution policy does not allow you to run this script, copy the contents to your own PowerShell script and execute that instead.
