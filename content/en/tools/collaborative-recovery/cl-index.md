# Collaborative Recovery

Collaborative Recovery is a secure, privacy-oriented solution that helps you identify and retrieve data if you ever encounter a disaster recovery (DR) scenario on your Business Network.

Once you have installed the Collaborative Recovery CorDapps, you can safely use Collaborative Recovery to detect potential ledger inconsistencies and recover any missing data from parties you have transacted with. Designed to ensure the continued security and privacy of Corda, this feature runs in the background, acting as an additional layer of security when using Corda.

As the name suggests, this is a collaborative method for recovering data. For maximum peace of mind, you should seek agreement across your Business Network to make this feature part of the overall disaster recovery policy.
