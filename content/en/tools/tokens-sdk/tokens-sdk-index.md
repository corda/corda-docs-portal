# Tokens SDK

The Tokens SDK provides you with the fastest and easiest way to create tokens that represent any kind of asset on your network. This asset can be anything you want it to be - conceptual, physical, valuable or not. You can create a token to represent something outside of the network, or something that only exists on the ledger - like a Corda-native digital currency.

With the SDK, you can define your token and its attributes, then add functionality to a CorDapp so the token can be issued, moved, and redeemed on a ledger.

{{< note >}}
Tokens SDK V1.2.2 is compatible with **Corda release version 4.6** and higher. Please use this version for Corda 4.6+ series work.

Please use the newest Tokens SDK V2.0 for Corda 5 Developer Preview (and future Corda 5.x series) work.
