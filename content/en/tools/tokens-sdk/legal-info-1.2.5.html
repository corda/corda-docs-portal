         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
             1.
          Definitions.
                  "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction, and distribution
              as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
                  "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by the copyright owner
                 that is granting the License.
                  "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all other entities that
                 control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity. For the purposes of
                 this definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
                 direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of
                 fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such
                 entity.
                  "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity exercising
                permissions granted by this License.
                  "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications, including but not
                limited to software source code, documentation source, and configuration files.
                  "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical transformation or
                 translation of a Source form, including but not limited to compiled object code, generated
                 documentation, and conversions to other media types.
                  "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form, made
                 available under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is included in or
                 attached to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
                  "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based
                 on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations,
                 elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.
                 For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
                 separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative
                 Works thereof.
                  "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the
                 Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is
                 intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an
                 individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner. For the
                 purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or
                 written communication sent to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited
                 to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking
                 systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing and
                 improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
                 designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
                  "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of whom
                 a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the
                 Work.
             2.
          Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor
             hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
             irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
             publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or
             Object form.
             3.
          Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor
             hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
             irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer
             to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to
             those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
             Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such
             Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity
             (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a
             Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent
             infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall
             terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
             4.
          Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof
             in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
             meet the following conditions:
                   (a)
              You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
                   (b)
              You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and
                   (c)
              You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all
                 copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                 excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and
                   (d)
              If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any
                 Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution
                 notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to
                 any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE
                 text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                 documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated
                 by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The
                 contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the
                 License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You
                 distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that
                 such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or
                 different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your
                 modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
                 reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated
                 in this License.
             5.
          Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution
             intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the
             terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
             Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate
             license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
             6.
          Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service
             marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use
             in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
             7.
          Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor
             provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS"
             BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including,
             without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY,
             or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
             appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your
             exercise of permissions under this License.
             8.
          Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including
             negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and
             grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for
             damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
             character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work
             (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or
             malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has
             been advised of the possibility of such damages.
             9.
          Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works
             thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty,
             indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However,
             in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole
             responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
             defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted
             against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional
             liability.
         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
         APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
         To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following boilerplate notice, with the fields
         enclosed by brackets "[]" replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't
         include the brackets!) The text should be enclosed in the appropriate comment syntax for the file

        GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
        Version 2.1, February 1999
      Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
      51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
      Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
      of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
      [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.
      It also counts as the successor of the GNU Library
      Public License, version 2, hence the version number 2.1.]
      Preamble
      The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
      freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public
      Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
      free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
      This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
      specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
      Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You
      can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
      this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
      strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
      When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not
      price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
      have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
      this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if
      you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new
      free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things.
      To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
      distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender
      these rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities
      for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
      For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
      or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we
      gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
      source code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide
      complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
      with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
      it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
      We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright
      the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you
      legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
      To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there
      is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified
      by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they
      have is not the original version, so that the original author's reputation
      will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others.
      Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence
      of any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot
      effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
      restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that
      any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
      consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
      Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by
      the ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU
      Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated
      libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General
      Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in
      order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.
      When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
      a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
      combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary
      General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire
      combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public
      License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library.
      We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License
      because it does Less to protect the user's freedom than the
      ordinary General Public License. It also provides other free
      software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free
      programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary
      General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser
      license provides advantages in certain special circumstances.
      For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
      encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that
      it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs
      must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a
      free library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.
      In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library
      to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
      In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
      programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free
      software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free
      programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating
      system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.
      Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of
      the users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that
      is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal
      to run that program using a modified version of the Library.
      The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
      modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between
      a "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".
      The former contains code derived from the library, whereas
      the latter must be combined with the library in order to run.
      TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
         0.
        This License Agreement applies to any software library or
        other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright
        holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed
        under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also
        called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as "you".
          A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
          prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
          (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
          The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
          which has been distributed under these terms. A "work based on
          the Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
          copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
          portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
          straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation
          is included without limitation in the term "modification".)
          "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
          for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source
          code means all the source code for all modules it contains,
          plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts
          used to control compilation and installation of the library.
          Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are
          not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of
          running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output
          from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a
          work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library
          in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what
          the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.
         1.
        You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete
        source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
        conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
        copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
        notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
        and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.
          You may charge a fee for the physical act of
          transferring a copy, and you may at your option
          offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
         2.
        You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
        of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
        distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section
        1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
             a)
            The modified work must itself be a software library.
             b)
            You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
            stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
             c)
            You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
            charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
             d)
            If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function
            or a table of data to be supplied by an application program
            that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed
            when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith
            effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not
            supply such function or table, the facility still operates,
            and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.
          (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots
          has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of
          the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
          application-supplied function or table used by this function
          must be optional: if the application does not supply it,
          the square root function must still compute square roots.)
          These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
          identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the
          Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate
          works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not
          apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
          works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a
          whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution
          of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose
          permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole,
          and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
          Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or
          contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather,
          the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution
          of derivative or collective works based on the Library.
          In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on
          the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the
          Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does
          not bring the other work under the scope of this License.
         3.
        You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General
        Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the
        Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer
        to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General
        Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a
        newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public
        License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead
        if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.
          Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
          that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to
          all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
          This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the
          code of the Library into a program that is not a library.
         4.
        You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative
        of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under
        the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
        it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code,
        which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2
        above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.
          If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
          from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
          the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement
          to distribute the source code, even though third parties are
          not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
         5.
        A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
        Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled
        or linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".
        Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the
        Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
          However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
          creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because
          it contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses
          the library". The executable is therefore covered by this License.
          Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
          When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header
          file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may
          be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is
          not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can
          be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.
          The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
          If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
          structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
          functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the
          object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally
          a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code
          plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)
          Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
          distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section
          6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
          whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
         6.
        As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
        link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce
        a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute
        that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms
        permit modification of the work for the customer's own use
        and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.
          You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work
          that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its
          use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of
          this License. If the work during execution displays copyright
          notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library
          among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the
          copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things:
             a)
            Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable
            source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in
            the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above);
            and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the
            complete machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as object
            code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library
            and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the
            modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the
            contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be
            able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)
             b)
            Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
            Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
            copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
            rather than copying library functions into the executable, and
            (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library,
            if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
            interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
             c)
            Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
            least three years, to give the same user the materials
            specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no
            more than the cost of performing this distribution.
             d)
            If distribution of the work is made by offering access to
            copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to
            copy the above specified materials from the same place.
             e)
            Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
            materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
          For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses
          the Library" must include any data and utility programs needed
          for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special
          exception, the materials to be distributed need not include
          anything that is normally distributed (in either source or
          binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel,
          and so on) of the operating system on which the executable
          runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.
          It may happen that this requirement contradicts the
          license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that
          do not normally accompany the operating system. Such
          a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the
          Library together in an executable that you distribute.
         7.
        You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
        Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
        facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a
        combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the
        work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is
        otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
             a)
            Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
            on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities.
            This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.
             b)
            Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
            that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
            where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
         8.
        You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the
        Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt
        otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
        the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights
        under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or
        rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
        terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
         9.
        You are not required to accept this License, since you have
        not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to
        modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These
        actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.
        Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any
        work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this
        License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
        distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.
         10.
        Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on
        the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license
        from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or
        modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You
        may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'
        exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible
        for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
         11.
        If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
        infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
        conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement
        or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License,
        they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you
        cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations
        under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a
        consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example,
        if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of
        the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly
        through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this
        License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
          If any portion of this section is held invalid or
          unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the
          balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section
          as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
          It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe
          any patents or other property right claims or to contest
          validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose
          of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution
          system which is implemented by public license practices. Many
          people have made generous contributions to the wide range of
          software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent
          application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to
          decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through
          any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
          This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is
          believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.
         12.
        If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
        certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,
        the original copyright holder who places the Library under this
        License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation
        excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only
        in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License
        incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
         13.
        The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
        versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
        Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
        but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
          Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If
          the Library specifies a version number of this License which
          applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of
          following the terms and conditions either of that version or of
          any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If
          the Library does not specify a license version number, you may
          choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
         14.
        If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs
        whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to
        the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by
        the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
        sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
        two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
        software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
          NO WARRANTY
         15.
        BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
        FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT
        WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER
        PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
        EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
        IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
        PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF
        THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU
        ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
         16.
        IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
        WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
        REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
        DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
        DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY
        (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
        INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
        THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER
        OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
        END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
        If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
        possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software
        that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by
        permitting redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively,
        under the terms of the ordinary General Public License).
        To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the
        library. It is safest to attach them to the start of each
        source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of
        warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright"
        line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
	 <one line to give the library's name
	and  an idea of what it does. >

                 differential comparisons against either the Original Code or another well known, available
                 Covered Code of the Contributor's choice. The Source Code can be in a compressed or

          Source Code License.

                 claims:

                  under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) Licensable by Initial
                     Developer to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the
                     Original Code (or portions thereof) with or without Modifications, and/or as part of a

                     Developer first distributes Original Code under the terms of this License.
                         d.
                  Notwithstanding Section 2.1 (b) above, no patent license is granted: 1) for code that You
                     delete from the Original Code; 2) separate from the Original Code; or 3) for
                     infringements caused by: i) the modification of the Original Code or ii) the
                     combination of the Original Code with other software or devices.
                   2.2.
              Contributor Grant. Subject to third party intellectual property claims, each Contributor
                 hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license
                         a.
                  under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) Licensable by
                     Contributor, to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute
                     the Modifications created by such Contributor (or portions thereof) either on an
                     unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Code and/or as part of a Larger
                     Work; and
                         b.
                  under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or selling of Modifications made by
                     that Contributor either alone and/or in combination with its Contributor Version (or
                     portions of such combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or
                     otherwise dispose of: 1) Modifications made by that Contributor (or portions thereof);
                     and 2) the combination of Modifications made by that Contributor with its Contributor
                     Version (or portions of such combination).
                         c.
                  the licenses granted in Sections 2.2 (a) and 2.2 (b) are effective on the date
                     Contributor first makes Commercial Use of the Covered Code.
                         d.
                  Notwithstanding Section 2.2 (b) above, no patent license is granted: 1) for any code that
                     Contributor has deleted from the Contributor Version; 2) separate from the Contributor
                     Version; 3) for infringements caused by: i) third party modifications of Contributor
                     Version or ii) the combination of Modifications made by that Contributor with other
                     software (except as part of the Contributor Version) or other devices; or 4) under
                     Patent Claims infringed by Covered Code in the absence of Modifications made by that
                     Contributor.
             3.
          Distribution Obligations.
                   3.1.
              Application of License. The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are
                 governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The
                 Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this
                 License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must
                 include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may
                 not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the
                 applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You
                 may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section
                 3.5.
                   3.2.
              Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute
                 must be made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the
                 same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism
                 to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via
                 Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months
                 after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a
                 subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available to such
                 recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains
                 available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third
                 party.
                   3.3.
              Description of Modifications. You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to
                 contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date
                 of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived,
                 directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including
                 the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an
                 Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership
                 of the Covered Code.
                   3.4.
              Intellectual Property Matters
                         (a)
                  Third Party Claims
         If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's intellectual
                         property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor
                         under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the
                         Source Code distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim
                         and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know
                         whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification
                         is made available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly
                         modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and
                         shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or
                         newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered
                         Code that new knowledge has been obtained.
                         (b)
                  Contributor APIs
         If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface
                         and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably
                         necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also include this
                         information in the LEGAL file.
                         (c)
                  Representations.
         Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4 (a) above,
                         Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are
                         Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient
                         rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.
                   3.5.
              Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code.
                 If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its
                 structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory)
                 where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more
                 Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit
                 A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You
                 describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may
                 choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
                 obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your
                 own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make
                 it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is
                 offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
                 Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a
                 result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
                   3.6.
              Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only
                 if the requirements of Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5 have been met for that Covered
                 Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code
                 is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You
                 have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included
                 in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You
                 describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the
                 Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice,
                 which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance
                 with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not
                 attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the
                 rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a
                 different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this
                 License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You
                 hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability
                 incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You
                 offer.
                   3.7.
              Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not
                 governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product.
                 In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the
                 Covered Code.
             4.
          Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.
          If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some
             or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a)
             comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the
             limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file
             described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code.
             Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
             sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
             5.
          Application of this License.
   This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in
                 Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.
             6.
          Versions of the License.
                   6.1.
              New Versions
      Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish revised and/or
                     new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a
                     distinguishing version number.
                   6.2.
              Effect of New Versions
      Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may
                     always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to
                     use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License
                     published by Netscape. No one other than Netscape has the right to modify the
                     terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.
                   6.3.
              Derivative Works
      If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order
                     to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License),
                     You must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases "Mozilla",
                     "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape", "MPL",
                     "NPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license
                     (except to note that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise
                     make it clear that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from
                     the Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of
                     the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in
                     Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)
             7.
          DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY
   COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY
                 OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES
                 THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE
                 OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED
                 CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE
                 INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY
                 SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL
                 PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER
                 THIS DISCLAIMER.
             8.
          Termination
                   8.1.
              This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to
                 comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of
                 the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive
                 any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect
                 beyond the termination of this License shall survive.
                   8.2.
              If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declatory
                 judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or
                 Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as "Participant")
                 alleging that:
                         a.
                  such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent,
                     then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or
                     2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate
                     prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree
                     in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past
                     and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your
                     litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If
                     within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not
                     mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not
                     withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2
                     automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified
                     above.
                         b.
                  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's Contributor
                     Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You
                     by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the
                     date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that
                     Participant.
                   8.3.
              If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such
                 Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where
                 such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of
                 patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such
                 Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the
                 amount or value of any payment or license.
                   8.4.
              In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license agreements
                 (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any
                 distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.
             9.
          LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
   UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE),
                 CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR
                 ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO
                 ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
                 CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE,
                 COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES,
                 EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS
                 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
                 RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS
                 SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF
                 INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO
                 YOU.
             10.
          U.S. government end users
   The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R.
                 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software" and
                 "commercial computer software documentation," as such terms are used in 48
                 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1
                 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code
                 with only those rights set forth herein.
             11.
          Miscellaneous
   This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any
                 provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be
                 reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be
                 governed by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any,
                 provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to
                 disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or
                 registered to do business in the United States of America, any litigation relating to
                 this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the
                 Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California,
                 with the losing party responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs
                 and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of the United
                 Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly
                 excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall
                 be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.
             12.
          Responsibility for claims
   As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and
                 damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this
                 License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute
                 such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be
                 deemed to constitute any admission of liability.
             13.
          Multiple-licensed code
   Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as "Multiple-Licensed".
               "Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial Developer permits you to utilize portions of the

            Creative Commons  Legal Code
         CC0 1.0 Universal
         CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS
         DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION
         ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT
         OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM THE
         USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER.
      Statement of Purpose
      The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer exclusive Copyright and Related
         Rights (defined below) upon the creator and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner")
         of an original work of authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").
      Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the purpose of contributing to a
         commons of creative, cultural and scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably
         and without fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse
         and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes, including without
         limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a
         free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain
         reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.
      For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of additional consideration
         or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that
         he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to
         the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and
         Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.
             1.
          Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by copyright and
             related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and Related Rights"). Copyright and
             Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the following:
                   i.
              the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate, and translate a Work;
                   ii.
              moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
                   iii.
              publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness depicted in a Work;
                   iv.
              rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work, subject to the limitations
                 in paragraph 4(a), below;
                   v.
              rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a Work;
                   vi.
              database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and
                 of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, and under any
                 national implementation thereof, including any amended or successor version of such
                 directive); and
                   vii.
              other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world based on applicable
                 law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.
             2.
          Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law,
             Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons,
             and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and
             causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims
             and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum
             duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any
             current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,
             including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the
             "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at
             large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such
             Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other
             legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as
             contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
             3.
          Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid
             or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent
             permitted taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to
             the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a
             royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and
             unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i)
             in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or
             treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any
             number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
             commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall
             be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of
             the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such
             partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and
             in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her
             remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and
             causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express
             Statement of Purpose.
             4.
          Limitations and Disclaimers.
                   a.
              No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned, surrendered, licensed
                 or otherwise affected by this document.
                   b.
              Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties of any kind
                 concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including without
                 limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non
                 infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or
                 absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible
                 under applicable law.
                   c.
              Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons that may apply to the
                 Work or any use thereof, including without limitation any person's Copyright and
                 Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any
                 necessary consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.
                   d.
              Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a party to this document
                 and has no duty or obligation with respect to this CC0 or use of the Work.

      Conditioned upon Your compliance with Section 3.1 below and subject to third party

                     royalty-free, non-exclusive license:

                   3.1.
                  Availability of Source Code.
      Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available in Executable form

                         distributed only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of this
                         License with every copy of the Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute
                         or otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any such Covered Software
                         in Executable form as to how they can obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form
                         in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.
                   3.2.
                  Modifications.
      The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of
                         this License. You represent that You believe Your Modifications are Your original
                         creation(s) and/or You have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this
                         License.
                   3.3.
                  Required Notices.
      You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that identifies You as the
                         Contributor of the Modification. You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or
                         trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or any notices of licensing
                         or any descriptive text giving attribution to any Contributor or the Initial
                         Developer.
                   3.4.
                  Application of Additional Terms.
      You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form that
                         alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients'
                         rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
                         indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software.
                         However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial
                         Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such
                         warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You
                         hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any
                         liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of
                         warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
                   3.5.
                  Distribution of Executable Versions.
      You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms of this
                         License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may contain terms
                         different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of
                         this License and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to limit or
                         alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in
                         this License. If You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a
                         different license, You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from
                         this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or Contributor.
                         You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any
                         liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any
                         such terms You offer.
                   3.6.
                  Larger Works.
      You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code not governed by
                         the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such
                         a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the
                         Covered Software.
             4.
          Versions of the License.
                   4.1.
                  New Versions.
      Oracle is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or new versions of this
                         License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.
                         Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right
                         to modify this License.
                   4.2.
                  Effect of New Versions.
      You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available
                         under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the
                         Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software
                         prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available under any subsequent
                         version of the License, You must distribute and make the Covered Software available
                         under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the
                         Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or otherwise make
                         the Covered Software available under the terms of any subsequent version of the
                         License published by the license steward.
                   4.3.
                  Modified Versions.
      When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for Your Original
                         Software, You may create and use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename
                         the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to
                         note that the license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that
                         the license contains terms which differ from this License.
             5.

                 PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND

                 DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR)
                 ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF
                 WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE
                 IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.
             6.
          TERMINATION.
                   6.1.
                  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply
                     with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach.
                     Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this
                     License shall survive.
                   6.2.
                  If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against
                     Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You
                     assert such claim is referred to as "Participant") alleging that the Participant
                     Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor or the
                     Original Software where the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly
                     infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or indirectly to You by such
                     Participant, the Initial Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all
                     Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from
                     Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice
                     period, unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the
                     Participant Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written
                     agreement with Participant.
                   6.3.
                  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that the Participant
                     Software directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by
                     license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the
                     reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall
                     be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.
                   6.4.
                  In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user licenses that have been
                     validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses
                     granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.
             7.
          LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
          UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT,
             OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF
             COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY
             INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
             LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR
             ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF
             THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR
             DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE
             LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF
             INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO
             YOU.
             8.
          U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.
          The Covered Software is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R.
             2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software" (as that term is
             defined at 48 C.F.R. § 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and "commercial computer software
             documentation" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with
             48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government
             End Users acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S.
             Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause
             or provision that addresses Government rights in computer software under this License.
             9.
          MISCELLANEOUS.
          This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision
             of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the
             extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of the
             jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within the Original Software (except to the
             extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction's
             conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the
             jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice
             contained within the Original Software, with the losing party responsible for costs,
             including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses.
             The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of
             Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a
             contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You agree
             that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United States export administration
             regulations (and the export control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use,
             distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.
             10.
          RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
          As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages
             arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to
             work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis.
             Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.
      NOTICE PURSUANT TO SECTION 9 OF THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION LICENSE (CDDL)
The code released under the CDDL shall be governed by the laws of the State of California
             (excluding conflict-of-law provisions). Any litigation relating to this License shall be
             subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California and
             the state courts of the State of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,
             California.

         Eclipse Public License - v 1.0
      THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC LICENSE
         ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES
         RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
             1.
          DEFINITIONS
   "Contribution" means:
                   a)
            in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation distributed under
               this Agreement, and
                   b)
            in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
                         i)
              changes to the Program, and
                         ii)
              additions to the Program;
              where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by
                 that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor
                 if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such
                 Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program
                 which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the
                 Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the
                 Program. 
            "Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program. 
            "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are
             necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined
             with the Program.
            "Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.
            "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,
             including all Contributors.
             2.
          GRANT OF RIGHTS
                   a)
            Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a
               non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative
               works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution
               of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code
               form.
                   b)
            Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a
               non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use,
               sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
               if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the
               combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added
               by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be
               covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
               combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.
                   c)
            Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions
               set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not
               infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each
               Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity
               based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to
               exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole
               responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For
               example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the
               Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing
               the Program.
                   d)
            Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its
               Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
             3.
          REQUIREMENTS
   A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own
                 license agreement, provided that:
                   a)
            it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
                   b)
            its license agreement:
                         i)
              effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions,
                 express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement,
                 and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular
                 purpose;
                         ii)
              effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including
                 direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost
                 profits;
                         iii)
              states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that
                 Contributor alone and not by any other party; and
                         iv)
              states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs
                 licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
                 used for software exchange.
            When the Program is made available in source code form:
                   a)
            it must be made available under this Agreement; and
                   b)
            a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.
      Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program.
            Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a
               manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the
               Contribution.
             4.
          COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
   Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end
                 users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate
                 the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a
                 commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
                 liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in
                 a commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor")
                 hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified
                 Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively
                 "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a
                 third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or
                 omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the
                 Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply
                 to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property
                 infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify
                 the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial
                 Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense
                 and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate
                 in any such claim at its own expense.
          For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X.
             That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes
             performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and
             warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section,
             the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related
             to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to
             pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.
             5.
          NO WARRANTY
   EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS
                 IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
                 IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,
                 NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient
                 is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing
                 the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this
                 Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
                 compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and
                 unavailability or interruption of operations.
             6.
          DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
   EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
                 SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR
                 CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND
                 ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING
                 NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE
                 PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
                 POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
             7.
          GENERAL
      If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect
         the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
         action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make
         such provision valid and enforceable.
            If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in
         a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
         or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted
         under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
            All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the
         material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period
         of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this
         Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as
         reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
         granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
            Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid
         inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The
         Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement
         from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The
         Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
         responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of
         the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may
         always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In
         addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the
         Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections
         2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
         Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights
         in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.
            This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the
         United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement
         more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in
         any resulting litigation.

						in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
								 i)
								changes to the Program, and
								 ii)
								additions to the Program;
						where
							such changes and/or additions to the Program originate
							from
							and
							are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A
							Contribution
							"originates"
							from a Contributor if it was added to the
							Program by such
							Contributor itself or anyone acting on such
							Contributor's
							behalf.
							Contributions do not include changes or
							additions to the
							Program that
							are not Modified Works.
				"Contributor"
					means any person or entity that Distributes the
					Program.
				"Licensed
					Patents"
					mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor
					which
					are necessarily
					infringed by the use or sale of its
					Contribution alone
					or when
					combined with the Program.
				"Program"
					means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with
					this
					Agreement.
				"Recipient"
					means anyone who receives the Program under this
					Agreement
					or any
					Secondary License (as applicable), including
					Contributors.
				"Derivative

					based on (or derived from) the Program and for
					which the
					editorial
					revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other
					modifications
					represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.
				"Modified
					Works"
					shall mean any work in Source Code or other form
					that
					results from
					an addition to, deletion from, or modification of
					the
					contents of
					the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any

					Program solely in each case
					in order to link to, bind by name, or
					subclass the Program or
					Modified
					Works thereof.
				"Distribute"
					means the acts of a) distributing or b) making
					available
					in any
					manner that enables the transfer of a copy.
				"Source
					Code"

				GRANT OF RIGHTS
						 a)
						Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
						grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
						copyright
						license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
						publicly display,
						publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the
						Contribution of
						such
						Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.
						 b)
						Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
						grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
						license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
						import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such
						Contributor,
						if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent
						license shall
						apply to the combination of the Contribution and the
						Program if,
						at the time the Contribution is added by the
						Contributor, such
						addition of the Contribution causes such
						combination to be covered
						by the Licensed Patents. The patent
						license shall not apply to any
						other combinations which include the
						Contribution. No hardware per
						se is licensed hereunder.
						 c)
						Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
						licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
						provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
						patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
						Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
						brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
						property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
						rights
						and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
						assumes sole
						responsibility to secure any other intellectual
						property rights
						needed,
						if any. For example, if a third party patent
						license is required to
						allow Recipient to Distribute the Program,
						it is Recipient's
						responsibility to acquire that license
						before distributing the
						Program.
						 d)
						Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
						sufficient
						copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
						the copyright
						license set forth in this Agreement.
						 e)
						Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no Contributor
						makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than those set
						forth
						in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's
						receipt of
						the
						Program under the terms of a Secondary License (if
						permitted under
						the terms of Section 3).
				 3.
				REQUIREMENTS
						 3.1
						If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:
								 a)
								the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in
								accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany
								the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the
								Program
								is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients
								how to
								obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium
								customarily
								used for software exchange; and
								 b)
								the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license
								different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
										 i)
										effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
										warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
										warranties
										or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
										implied
										warranties
										or conditions of merchantability and fitness
										for a particular
										purpose;
										 ii)
										effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
										liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
										incidental
										and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
										 iii)
										does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
										in the
										Source Code under section 3.2; and
										 iv)
										requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any
										party
										to be under a license that satisfies the requirements of
										this
										section 3.
						 3.2
						When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:
								 a)
								it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the
								Program (i)
								is combined with other material in a separate file or
								files made
								available
								under a Secondary License, and (ii) the
								initial Contributor attached
								to
								the Source Code the notice
								described in Exhibit A of this
								Agreement,
								then the Program may be
								made available under the terms of such
								Secondary Licenses, and
								 b)
								a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the
								Program.
						 3.3
						Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,
						trademark,
						attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or
						limitations of liability
						("notices")
						contained within the Program
						from any copy of the Program which
						they Distribute, provided that
						Contributors may add their own
						appropriate
						notices.
				 4.
				COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
				Commercial
					distributors of software may accept certain
					responsibilities
					with
					respect to end users, business partners and the
					like. While this
					license is intended to facilitate the commercial
					use of the
					Program, the
					Contributor who includes the Program in a
					commercial
					product offering should
					do so in a manner which does not
					create
					potential liability for
					other
					Contributors. Therefore, if a
					Contributor includes the Program in a
					commercial product offering,
					such Contributor ("Commercial
					Contributor")
					hereby agrees to defend
					and indemnify every other Contributor
					("Indemnified
					Contributor")
					against any losses, damages and costs
					(collectively "Losses")
					arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions
					brought by a
					third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the
					extent
					caused
					by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in
					connection
					with its distribution of the Program in a commercial
					product offering.
					The obligations in this section do not apply to
					any claims or
					Losses relating
					to any actual or alleged intellectual
					property infringement. In
					order to
					qualify, an Indemnified
					Contributor must: a) promptly notify the
					Commercial Contributor in
					writing of such claim, and b) allow the
					Commercial
					Contributor to
					control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in,
					the
					defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified
					Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.
				For example, a Contributor might include the Program
					in a
					commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is
					then a
					Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes
					performance
					claims, or offers warranties related to Product X,
					those
					performance
					claims
					and warranties are such Commercial
					Contributor's responsibility
					alone.
					Under this section, the
					Commercial Contributor would have to defend
					claims
					against the other
					Contributors related to those performance claims and
					warranties,
					and
					if a court requires any other Contributor to pay
					any damages
					as
					a
					result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.
				 5.
				NO WARRANTY
				EXCEPT
					AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
					PERMITTED
					BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS
					IS"
					BASIS, WITHOUT
					WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS
					OR IMPLIED INCLUDING,
					WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR
					CONDITIONS OF TITLE,
					NON-INFRINGEMENT,
					MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS
					FOR
					A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is
					solely responsible for
					determining the appropriateness of using and
					distributing the
					Program and assumes all risks associated with its
					exercise of
					rights
					under this Agreement, including but not limited
					to the
					risks
					and costs
					of program errors, compliance with applicable laws,
					damage
					to or loss
					of data, programs or equipment, and
					unavailability or
					interruption of
					operations.
				 6.
				DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
				EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE
					EXTENT PERMITTED
					BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY
					CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE
					ANY
					LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,
					INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY,
					OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING
					WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
					PROFITS),
					HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY
					OF
					LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,
					STRICT
					LIABILITY, OR TORT
					(INCLUDING
					NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY
					OUT OF THE
					USE OR
					DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF
					ANY RIGHTS
					GRANTED
					HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
					DAMAGES.
				 7.
				GENERAL
				If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable
					under
					applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or
					enforceability of the
					remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and
					without further
					action by the
					parties hereto, such provision shall
					be
					reformed to the minimum extent
					necessary to make such provision
					valid and enforceable.
				If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
					(including a
					cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging
					that
					the Program itself
					(excluding combinations of the Program with
					other
					software or
					hardware)
					infringes such Recipient's
					patent(s), then
					such Recipient's
					rights granted
					under Section
					2(b) shall
					terminate as of the date such litigation is
					filed.
				All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate
					if it fails to
					comply with any of the material terms or conditions
					of this Agreement
					and
					does not cure such failure in a reasonable
					period of time after
					becoming
					aware of such noncompliance. If all
					Recipient's rights under this
					Agreement
					terminate, Recipient
					agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program
					as soon as
					reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's
					obligations under
					this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to
					the
					Program shall continue and survive.
				Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this
					Agreement,
					but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is
					copyrighted and
					may
					only be modified in the following manner. The
					Agreement Steward
					reserves
					the right to publish new versions
					(including revisions) of this
					Agreement
					from time to time. No one
					other than the Agreement Steward has the
					right
					to modify this
					Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial
					Agreement
					Steward.
					The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as
					the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new
					version of
					the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version
					number. The
					Program
					(including Contributions) may always be
					Distributed subject to the version
					of the Agreement under which it
					was received. In addition, after a
					new
					version of the Agreement is
					published, Contributor may elect to
					Distribute
					the Program
					(including
					its Contributions) under the new version.
				Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above,
					Recipient
					receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual
					property of any
					Contributor under this Agreement, whether
					expressly,
					by
					implication,
					estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the
					Program not
					expressly granted
					under this Agreement are reserved.
					Nothing in this
					Agreement is
					intended
					to be enforceable by any
					entity that is not a
					Contributor or
					Recipient.
					No third-party
					beneficiary rights are
					created under this Agreement.
				Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice
				"This
					Source Code may also be made available under the following
					Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set
					forth
					in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name
					license(s),
					version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions
					here}."
				Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit
					A
					is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary
					Licenses.
				If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a
					particular file,
					then You may include the notice in a location (such
					as a LICENSE file
					in
					a
					relevant directory) where a recipient would be
					likely to look for
					such a notice.
				You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

         ANTLR 2 License
      We reserve no legal rights to the ANTLR--it is fully in the public domain. An individual or company may
         do whatever they wish with source code distributed with ANTLR or the code generated by ANTLR,
         including the incorporation of ANTLR, or its output, into commerical software.
      We encourage users to develop software with ANTLR. However, we do ask that credit is given to us for
         developing ANTLR. By "credit", we mean that if you use ANTLR or incorporate any source code into one
         of your programs (commercial product, research project, or otherwise) that you acknowledge this fact
         somewhere in the documentation, research report, etc... If you like ANTLR and have developed a nice
         tool with the output, please mention that you developed it using ANTLR. In addition, we ask that the
         headers remain intact in our source code. As long as these guidelines are kept, we expect to continue
         enhancing this system and expect to make other tools available as they are completed.
