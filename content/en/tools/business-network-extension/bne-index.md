# The Corda Business Network membership extension

This Corda platform extension allows you to create and manage business networks - as a node operator, this means you can define and create a logical network based on a set of common CorDapps as well as a shared business context.

Corda nodes outside of your business network are not aware of its members. The network can be split into subgroups or membership lists which allows for further privacy (members of a group only know about those in their group).

In a business network, there is at least one authorized member. This member has sufficient permissions to execute management operations over the network and its members.
