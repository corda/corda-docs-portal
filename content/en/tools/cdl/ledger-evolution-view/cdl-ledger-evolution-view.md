# CDL - Ledger Evolution View

The Ledger Evolution view shows a sequence of Ledger transactions involving the Primary states which conform to the constraints defined in the Smart Contract. You can think of this view as a way of seeing a smart contract *in action*. You can use it to bring a smart contract to life by telling a story about how it might be used.

For example, a Ledger Evolution diagram for your Agreement example smart contract might look like this:
