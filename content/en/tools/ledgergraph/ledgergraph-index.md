# LedgerGraph

LedgerGraph is a CorDapp you can use to get in-memory access to transaction data. Transaction information is kept in a graph structure on any node where LedgerGraph is installed. As not all transactions are related to all other transactions, there can actually be multiple components in the graph: each a directed acyclic graph (DAG).

LedgerGraph enables other CorDapps, such as the set of Collaborative Recovery CorDapps, to have near real-time access to data concerning all of a nodeâ€™s transactions and their relationships. Without it, many operations would be unacceptably slow and impractical.

{{< warning >}}
LedgerGraph is a dependency for the set of [Collaborative Recovery](../../../en/tools/collaborative-recovery/ci-index.md) CorDapps V1.1 and above. If you are using an earlier version of Collaborative Recovery, you should not install the stand-alone LedgerGraph.
