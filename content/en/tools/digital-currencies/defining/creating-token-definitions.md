---


Before [tokens can be minted]({{< relref "../minting/_index.md" >}}), you must create a {{< tooltip >}}token definition{{< definitiondc term="token definition" >}}{{< /tooltip >}}.

1. In the Digital Currencies GUI, select **Define Token**.

   The **Define Token** page is displayed:
   
   {{< 
      figure
	  src="images/define-token-page.png"
      width=80%
	  figcaption="Define Token Page"
	  alt="Define Token Page"
   >}}
   
   The page displays two panels:
   
   * **New Token Definition:** Enables you to define a new token definition.
   * **Active Token Definitions:** Lists any existing token definitions.
   
   The **New Token Definition** panel initially shows the **Details** stage of the user journey.
   
2. In the **New Token Definition** panel, specify the following parameters:

   * **Token Name:** The name of the token definition; normally the full name of the currency; for example, UAE Dirham.
   * **Token Symbol:** A symbol for the token definition; normally the [three-letter ISO-4217 code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217) for the currency; for example, AED.
   * **Token Decimal Place:** An integer that specifies the number of decimal places for the currency; for many currencies this is 2.
   
   <!-- Keep the above descriptions in sync with those in the overview -->
   
3. Click **Next**.

   The **New Token Definition** panel is refreshed to show the **Parties** stage of the user journey:
   
   {{< 
      figure
	  src="images/new-token-definition-parties-stage.png"
      width=80%
	  figcaption="New Token Definition - Parties Stage"
	  alt="New Token Definition - Parties Stage"
   >}}
   
4. Specify the following parameters:

   * **Issuer:** The name of the Token Issuing Entity; this is the party on the network that can issue tokens of this type. This party will make the final decision whether an issuance happens or not.
   * **Custodian:** The name of the Custodian; they are the party on the network responsible for the exchange of off-ledger collateral when a non-issuing party requests tokens of this token definition state from the Token Issuer. This partyâ€™s responsibility is to inform the issuer that a requesting bank has paid for the token they are requesting. This setting is optional and can be "None".

5. Click **Next**.

   The **New Token Definition** panel is refreshed to show the **Rules** stage of the user journey:
   
   {{< 
      figure
	  src="images/new-token-definition-rules-stage.png"
      width=80%
	  figcaption="New Token Definition - Rules Stage"
	  alt="New Token Definition - Rules Stage"
   >}}
   
   {{< note >}}
   This stage is not yet operative.
   {{</ note >}}
   
6. Click **Next**.

   The **New Token Definition** panel is refreshed to show the **Review** stage of the user journey: 
   
   {{< 
      figure
	  src="images/new-token-definition-review-stage.png"
      width=80%
	  figcaption="New Token Definition - Review Stage"
	  alt="New Token Definition - Review Stage"
   >}}
   
7. Select **I confirm that the details are correct** and click **Submit**.

   The token definition is submitted and a success message is displayed:

   {{< 
      figure
	  src="images/token-definition-success.png"
      width=50%
	  figcaption="Token Definition Success"
	  alt="Token Definition Success"
   >}}
   
   The token definition flow begins and its progress can be checked in the pull-out flow tracker on the right-hand side of the screen:
    
   {{< 
      figure
	  src="images/define-token-flow-running.png"
      width=50%
	  figcaption="Creating Token Definitions - Flow Running"
	  alt="Creating Token Definitions - Flow Running"
   >}}  
   
   Once the token definition flow completes, the message *A new token definition has been successfully created* is displayed:

   {{< 
      figure
	  src="images/a-new-token-definition-created-message.png"
      width=50%
	  figcaption="'A New Token Definition has Been Successfully Created' Message"
	  alt="'A new token definition has been successfully created' Message"
   >}}  
   
   The flow status is displayed as **Completed**:
     
   {{< 
      figure
	  src="images/define-token-flow-completed.png"
      width=50%
	  figcaption="Creating Token Definitions - Flow Completed"
	  alt="Creating Token Definitions - Flow Completed"
   >}} 
   
   The new token definition now appears in the **Active Token Definitions** pane:
   
   {{< 
      figure
	  src="images/active-token-definitions-new-token.png"
      width=50%
	  figcaption="Active Token Definitions - New Token"
	  alt="Active Token Definitions - New Token"
   >}}
   
   You can also view both the list of active token definitions and decommissioned token definitions by selecting **Token Definitions** in the left-hand toolbar to view the **Token Definitions** page:
   
   {{< 
      figure
	  src="images/token-definitions-page.png"
      width=100%
	  figcaption="Token Definitions Page"
	  alt="Token Definitions Page"
   >}}
   #
   
<!-- Future - Once the token definition has been created, it must go through a number of business units to gain approval, before being broadcast to the token issuing entity. In a central bank, this maybe a policy department; in a commercial bank, the legal department. There can be multiple approvers and each must be able to approve, reject or amend the definition in order to meet approval guidelines. 

The token defining entity cannot publish the token definition to the TIE unless the token is approved.  --> 

Now that a token definition has been created, you can:

* [View existing token definitions]({{< relref "viewing-token-definitions.md" >}})
* [Mint tokens based on that definition]({{< relref "../minting/_index.md" >}})
