**Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC)** A central bank-issued digital money, denominated in a national unit of account, which is backed by the full faith and credit of the issuing central bank.

**Defining** Creating a token definition, which specifies the properties that a token of that type may have. Defining a token is a similar process for CBDCs and for commercial bank-issued stablecoins; however, the approval process may differ.

**Issuing party** The network participant which has the authority to take minted tokens and issue them to other parties.

**Redeeming** When a commercial bank or central bank removes a token, which it defined, from a transacting entity or a network.

Their function is to review the token definition presented and approve or reject. Central Bank: Board of Governors. Commercial Bank: Head of Legal Services or Head of Regulation/Compliance.

**Token Defining Entity (TDE)** The entity that authors and initiates token definitions. TDEs can define multiple token definitions. In a central bank, this may be Currency Vault Management, while in a commercial bank, it may be Head of Treasury.
