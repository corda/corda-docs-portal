This topic describes how to view and change settings associated with the GUI, such as its theme.

* Click the **Settings** button (![](images/setting-buttons.png)).

  The following page is displayed:
  
  {{< 
      figure
	  src="images/settings-page.png"
      width=80%
	  figcaption="Settings Page"
	  alt="Settings Page"
  >}}
     
The page displays the following panels:

* **Settings**: This panel displays the following configurable settings:

  * **Dark app theme:** Select this option to change the GUI to have a dark  background.
  * **Show flow tracker:** Select this option to display the flow tracker button on the right-hand side of the GUI. 
  * **Hide flow tracker on click away:** Select this option to automatically hide the flow tracker if the user clicks anywhere outside it.

* **VNode Details:** This panel displays the X.500 and Short Hash values specified for the virtual node, as described in [Installing the Digital Currencies Demo]({{< relref "installing-the-dc-demo.md" >}}). These values are not changeable in the GUI.

  The **Select App Config** option is used to switch between participants/virtual nodes in the network. For more information, see [Switching Roles]({{< relref "switching-roles.md" >}}).
