Once a token type has been defined, tokens of that type can be issued. Issuing tokens involves both creating the tokens and then transfering them to the relevant entities.  

The general process of issuance, and the on-ledger actions involved will be very similar, if not identical, for both central bank  and SC. However, the permissions of these on-ledger actions may be divided differently based on implementation. For example, in {{< tooltip >}}CBDC{{< definitiondc term="CBDC" >}}{{< /tooltip >}} issuance, the custodian and the token issuing entity will both be a central bank, while these roles may be divided for a stablecoin.
