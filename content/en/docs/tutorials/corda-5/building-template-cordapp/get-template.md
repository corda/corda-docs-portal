title: Building a CorDapp from a template
---

Now that you've gotten the demo CorDapp up and running, it's time to build your own CorDapp by following the Corda 5 Developer Preview CorDapp template. This learning path walks you through modifying the template to create a CorDapp and get it up and running.

Follow these steps to build a CorDapp using the template:

1. [Get the template](#get-the-template)
2. [Modify the state](modify-state.md)
3. [Modify the contract](modify-contract.md)
4. [Modify the flow](modify-flow.md)
5. [Run your CorDapp](run-cordapp.md)
