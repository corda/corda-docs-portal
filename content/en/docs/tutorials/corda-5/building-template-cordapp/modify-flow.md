<!-- These are notes for now, this list is not exhaustive.
## Changes from Corda 4

* `signInitialTransaction` has been renamed to `sign`.
* `SignedTransactionDigest` - A new class that returns transaction IDs, signatures, and states in a JSON format, which lets you send it over RPC.  << This can be mentioned in the flows tutorial.
* `mapOfParams` - JSON parameters are parsed into a map, and then these parameters are validated to make sure the flow has everything it needs. This happened under the hood in Corda 4.-->
