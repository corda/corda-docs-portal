# Gateway Service

The Gateway Service acts as common entry point for remote management of Corda Nodes as well as networks using CENM - either using the available command-line tools or via the web applications hosted by the Gateway.

{{< warning >}}
The Gateway Service does not need its own database - so there is no database configuration required when you are setting up.
{{< /warning >}}


## Install the Gateway Service

You can install the Gateway Service by installing the Gateway Service `.jar` file:

`java -jar gateway-service.jar -f config.conf`

## Configure the Gateway Service

When you configure the Gateway Service, you need to:

1. Specify the endpoint where the Auth Service is exposed - this must match the IP or host name of the machine/VM/container and the port that is configured in the Auth Service config file.

2. Specify the SSL configuration for connecting to the Auth Service. You can do this using the [PKI tool](../../../cenm/1.5/pki-tool).

3. Your authentication credentials, as specified in your [Auth Service configuration](auth-service).

4. Your Zone Service address.

You can create a configuration file as shown in the sample, and then add this to your CENM services using the command line commands below.

```
# Configuration dependent on the Auth service install
auth {
    # This is the endpoint where the auth service is exposed, should be the IP or host name of
    # the machine/VM/container and the port that was configured in the auth service conf file
    serverUrl = "https://auth-service:8081/"
    # SSL config for connecting to the auth service
    # Should be the same trust store that is used when configuring the auth service
    # Generally generated by the PKI Tool
    sslConfig = {
        trustStore = "/usr/gateway/certificates/corda-ssl-trust-store.jks"
        trustStorePassword = "trustpass"
    }
    # Client credentials that were configured in the auth service conf file like so:
    # clientConfig = {
    #   clients = [
    #       {
    #           clientId = "gateway1"
    #           clientSecret = "secret1"
    #           scopes = [
    #               "accounts:admin"
    #           ]
    #           audience = [
    #               "zone",
    #               "network-map",
    #               "identity-manager"
    #           ]
    #       }
    #   ]
    clientCredentials = {
        clientId = "gateway1"
        clientSecret = "secret1"
    }
}

# application-specific configuration should go here

# port to bind to (defaults to 8080)
server {
    port = 8080
}
```

## Manage Gateway Service configuration

Name of the distribution: `gateway-service.jar`

Command line arguments:

* `--logging-level=` - Enable logging at this level and higher. Defaults to INFO. Possible values: OFF, INFO, WARN, TRACE, DEBUG, ERROR, ALL
* `-f, --config-file=` `--config-obfuscation-passphrase[=]` - The passphrase used in the key derivation function when generating an AES key
* `--config-obfuscation-seed[=]` - The seed used in the key derivation function to create a salt
* `-h, --help`
* `-V, --version`

## Installing applications onto the Gateway Service

{{< note >}}
[Auth Service](auth-service) needs to be set up with baseline permission data for each application.
{{< /note >}}

* [CENM management console](../../../cenm/1.5/cenm-console)
* [Node management console](management-console)
* [Flow management console](node-flow-management-console)
