# Tools and utilities

A small number of tools and utilities are available to help with setting up, running, and testing a network.

## Public Key Infrastructure

* [Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) Tool](pki-tool.md)

## Node Certificate Rotation Tool

This tool enables the reissuing of node legal identity keys and certificates, allowing CENM to re-register a node (including a notary node) with a new certificate in the Network Map. For more information about this feature, contact [R3 support](https://www.r3.com/support/).

## General running of network

* [Certificate Revocation Request Submission Tool](tool-crr-submission.md)

## Operations and administration
