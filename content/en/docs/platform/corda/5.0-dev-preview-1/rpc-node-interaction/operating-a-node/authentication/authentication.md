  Instructions on how to configure authentication and authorization for HTTP-RPC.
---

Most of the endpoints exposed via HTTP-RPC require authentication.
However, there is one internal endpoint which doesn't, `getProtocolVersion`.

You can test this functionality using Swagger UI (if enabled):

![Authenticate on Swagger UI](swagger-auth.png "Authenticate on Swagger UI")

{{< note >}}

Unauthorized responses will return the configured authentication types and their parameters via [WWW-Authenticate](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/WWW-Authenticate) response headers.

{{< /note >}}

Corda 5 nodes support [Basic authentication](#set-up-basic-authentication) and [Azure Active Directory (AD) single sign-on (SSO)](#set-up-azure-ad-sso).

## Set up basic authentication

You can use authenticated HTTP-RPC endpoints with [basic HTTP authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication) using the username/password combinations set up for RPC use. To configure user credentials in the `node.conf` file or through the use of an external database, see the guide on [managing RPC security](https://docs.corda.net/docs/corda-os/4.8/clientrpc.html#managing-rpc-security) in Corda 4.

This feature is enabled by default and cannot be disabled.

### Configure authorization

Authorization in Corda 5 uses the same Apache Shiro-based solution that was available in Corda 4. For details on how to configure this, see the guide on [managing RPC security](https://docs.corda.net/docs/corda-os/4.8/clientrpc.html#managing-rpc-security) in Corda 4.

### Test your configuration

You can test your configuration using Swagger UI:

![Basic authentication on Swagger UI](swagger_basic.png "Basic authentication on Swagger UI")

## Set up Azure AD SSO

You can set up your Corda 5 node to use Azure Active Directory (AD) for single sign-on (SSO). Authorized users who can access HTTP-RPC functions on the node can use their Azure AD credentials to stay logged in to any applications that use the HTTP-RPC API.

You need to configure the Azure AD tenant that serves as an identity provider and the node to enable HTTP-RPC endpoints to support Azure AD-based authentication.

This authentication type requires an Azure AD **ID token** or **access token** to be passed with the HTTP-RPC requests as a [Bearer Token](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750). The node verifies the following properties/claims of the token:

* Expiration date.
* Issuer (should be a valid Microsoft Identity Platform value).
* Audience (should be the `clientId` of the node).

You can test this functionality using Swagger UI. The data flow should look like this:

![Example data flow](example_flow.png "Example data flow")

{{< note >}}
You can generate tokens using any method that is supported by the Microsoft Identity Platform, as long as it can be verified using the parameters above. This may mean different flows are used than those shown in the diagram.

### Configure Azure

This describes a basic setup. Configuring a production setup may include addition steps, such as those for user access management and permission sets (scopes).

To complete the configuration of your node using the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/):

1. Navigate to the *register an application* screen (Manage > App registration > New registration).

2. Complete the online form to represent your node:

![Register a new application](step2.png "Register a new application")

3. Make a note of the "Application (client) ID" and "Directory (tenant) ID". You need these to configure your node.

![Record application details](step3.png "Record application details")

4. Set authentication to ensure only accounts in this directory can use the app:

![Set authentication](step4.png "Set authentication")

5. Make the following menu selections: Manage > Authentication, Platform configuration > Add a platform, Configure platforms > Single-page application.

{{< note >}}

You may need to use different configuration depending on the types of application that need to access the HTTP-RPC. This setup is for testing with Swagger UI.

Applications accessing the HTTP-RPC should use a different application registration and the [On-Behalf-Of flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-on-behalf-of-flow).

You can register an application without implicit flows. You'll need to create a [**client secret**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app#add-a-client-secret) and include it in the application authenticating. If you're using the Swagger UI, it can be entered there.

{{< /note >}}

6. Set the **redirect URI** to `http(s)://<host>:<port>/webjars/swagger-ui/3.44.0/oauth2-redirect.html`, and select implicit grant as `Ã¬d_tokens`.

7. Under **Manage**, select **API permissions**, and add user permissions. You must apply `User.Read` as a minimum, but you can select scopes with wider permissions to suit your requirements.

![Add user permissions](step8.png "Add user permissions")

You have finished configuring Azure.

### Configure your node

Azure AD SSO is configured via a top-level object named `httpRpcSettings` in `node.conf`:

```
"httpRpcSettings": {
    ...
    "sso": {
        "azureAd": {
            "clientId": "<client_id>",
            "clientSecret": "<client_secret>"
            "tenantId": "<tenant_id>",
            "principalNameClaims": ["<claim1>", "<claim2>"]
        }
    }
}
```

Configuration options include:

| Field              | Required? | Value |
| ---------------- | --------- | ----- |
| `clientSecret`     | Optional | Auto fills the client-secret field on the Swagger UI authentication page when a non-public client flow is configured on Azure. *This field will be exposed on Swagger UI*. |
| `principalNameClaims` | Optional | A prioritized list of [**claims**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-optional-claims) that the node retrieves from the Azure AD-generated JSON web token (JWT) to then identify the user and fetch their permissions. Defaults to `["upn", "preferred_username", "email", "appid", "azp"]`.|

### Configure authorization

Permissions are retrieved using the same Apache Shiro-based solution as for [basic authentication](#configure-authorization-for-basic-authentication). Therefore, permissions can be set up in the same way. However, the actual name
of the user will be derived from Azure `claims`. For Azure AD SSO authentication, **JWT tokens** are used to verify a user's identity. Therefore, users listed in the Shiro database should *not* specify a password:

```
"rpcUsers": [
    {
        "user": "user1@company.com",
        "permissions": [
            "ALL"
        ]
    }
]
```

{{< note >}}

Username matching uses the extracted principal name claim, which can change depending on the type of JWT provided and the `principalNameClaims` configuration item.

### Test your configuration

You can test your setup using the Swagger UI:
