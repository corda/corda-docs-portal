# Upgrading CorDapps to Corda Enterprise 4.5

{{< warning >}}
Corda Enterprise 4.5.4 fixes a security vulnerability in the JPA notary. Before upgrading to Corda Enterprise 4.5.4 please read the guidance on [upgrading your notary service](notary/upgrading-the-ha-notary-service.md/).
{{< /warning >}}

## Upgrading from Open Source


### Running on Corda Enterprise 4.5

A prerequisite to upgrade to Corda Enterprise 4.5 is to ensure your CorDapp is upgraded to Open Source Corda 4.x.
Please follow the instructions in [Upgrading CorDapps to newer Platform Versions](app-upgrade-notes.md) section to complete this initial step.

There is no requirement to re-compile your CorDapp to Corda Enterprise in order to run it on Corda Enterprise. If you wish your CorDapp to
be compatible with nodes running Open Source, then compiling against Open Source Corda V4.x will suffice.
However, if you wish to leverage Corda Enterprise specific features, such as 3rd party commercial database support, and do not intend
for your CorDapp to run in an open source production environment, then please follow the instructions [here](#recompiling-for-enterprise)

{{< note >}}
Corda open source and Enterprise Public APIs are currently identical but this may change in future releases of Corda Enterprise.
Please read [Corda and Corda Enterprise compatibility](version-compatibility.md) guarantees.

{{< /note >}}


### Re-compiling for Corda Enterprise 4.5

Re-compiling your CorDapp requires updating its associated Gradle build file as follows:

```shell
ext.corda_release_distribution = 'com.r3.corda'
ext.corda_core_release_distribution = 'net.corda'
ext.corda_release_version = '4.5'
ext.corda_core_release_version = '4.5'
ext.corda_gradle_plugins_version = '5.0.8'
ext.kotlin_version = '1.2.71'
ext.quasar_version = '0.7.12_r3'
```

and specifying an additional repository entry to point to the location of the Corda Enterprise distribution and Corda dependencies. Any
dependencies on `corda-core` and/or `corda-serialization` must use the `corda_core_release_distribution` and
`corda_core_release_version` - as Corda is moving to an open core model, these core APIs are only available in open source and need to
be imported from there. Therefore, a repository entry pointing to a matching Corda Open Source version is always required.

If your project is based on one of the official cordapp templates, it is likely you have a `lib/quasar.jar` checked in.  It is worth noting
that you only use this if you use the JUnit runner in IntelliJ.  In the latest release of the cordapp templates, this directory has
been removed.

As an example:

```shell
repositories {
    // Example for Corda Enterprise
    maven {
        credentials {
            username "username"
            password "XXXXX"
        }
        url 'https://artifactory.mycompany.com/artifactory/corda-enterprise'
    }

    // Dependency on Corda Open Source
    maven { url "https://software.r3.com/artifactory/corda" }

    // Corda dependencies for the patched Quasar version
    maven { url "https://software.r3.com/artifactory/corda-dependencies" } // access to the patched Quasar version
}
```


* Upgrade your `quasar.jar` to the version consistent with your Corda version
* Delete your `lib` directory and switch to using the Gradle test runner

While the Corda Gradle Plugins need no changes apart from the version, ensure that Corda Enterprise dependencies are referenced with the right distribution. As an example:

```shell
cordaCompile "net.corda:corda-core:$corda_release_version"
testCompile "net.corda:corda-node-driver:$corda_release_version"
```

becomes:

```shell
cordaCompile "$corda_core_release_distribution:corda-core:$corda_core_release_version" // core depends on Open Source
testCompile "$corda_release_distribution:corda-node-driver:$corda_release_version"     // node based tests from Enterprise
```

{{< note >}}
Corda Enterprise 4.5 binaries are not available in a public repository. In order to make the dependencies available for development, either
create a mirror repository and upload them there, or add them to the local Maven repository.

Please consult your R3 support contact to request a copy of the Corda Enterprise Developer Pack (this contains a Maven repository mirror
of all Corda Enterprise artifacts and their dependencies).

{{< /note >}}

{{< warning >}}
In Corda 4 the original Finance CorDapp was split into two CorDapps: Contracts and Workflows, both of which are signed `.jar` files.
To ensure there is only one unique hashed version of the Finance Contracts `.jar` file (recall, the hash of a Contract `.jar` file undergoes strict
security checking upon transaction resolution) we only publish a single instance of the Finance Contracts `.jar` file (from the open source repository).
Please ensure any CorDapps that depend on Finance Contract `.jar` file reference this open source dependency as follows:

```shell
cordapp "$os_corda_release_distribution:corda-finance-contracts:$os_corda_release_version"
```

where

```shell
ext.os_corda_release_distribution = 'net.corda'
ext.os_corda_release_version = '4.0'
```

{{< /warning >}}



## Upgrading from Enterprise 4.3 or earlier

As of Corda Enterprise 4.4 we have moved towards an open core strategy. Therefore, the common APIs are only available in Corda
Open Source, and Corda Enterprise has a binary dependency on the matching Open Source version. As a result, any CorDapps written against
Corda Enterprise 4.4 or later will have to depend on the open source version of `corda-core`.

Therefore you have to add the following variables to your build configuration:

```shell
ext.corda_core_release_distribution = 'net.corda'
ext.corda_core_release_version = '4.5'
```

Any dependency on `corda-core` (or `corda-serialization`) has to use these new variables to depend on the open source version of those
libraries, so:

```shell
cordaCompile "$corda_release_distribution:corda-core:$corda_release_version"
```

becomes:

```shell
cordaCompile "$ext.corda_core_release_distribution:corda-core:$ext.corda_core_release_version"
```


## Upgrading from Enterprise 3.x

Firstly, please update all your CorDapp project dependencies as described in [re-compiling for Corda Enterprise](#recompiling-for-enterprise).


Adjust your CorDapp source code as necessary to take into account the following upgrade constraints:



* Contract CorDapps `.jar` files with external dependencies. Refers to a Contract CorDapp `.jar` file that depends on one or more classes from another independently classloaded `.jar` file (which may be another
Contract CorDapp `.jar` file or a third-party library). Prior to Corda 4, the node used a single applications classloader for loading all CorDapps and 3rd party `.jar` files (including node dependencies
themselves). Corda 4 introduced an isolated classloader - the **attachments classloader** - for the sole purpose of transaction verification.
Upon transaction verification, this classloader will attempt to resolve Contract CorDapp attachments from its internal attachments storage
(this holds all versions of all Contract CorDapps loaded by the node from its /cordapps directory or manually uploaded using the RPC
`uploadAttachment` secure API). However, Contract CorDapps **do not currently have a mechanism to explicitly specify dependencies on
external classes from other `.jar` files** so the attachments classloader has no means of knowing what other dependent `.jar` files to classload. The implications of this are as follows:
* Contract CorDapps should be packaged as **fat JARs** in Corda 4: they should be self-contained and include all classes required by the attachments classloader.
* Contract states created pre-Corda 4 using CorDapps that, purposefully or inadvertently had external dependencies on other `.jar` files, would
seamlessly verify in transactions a pre-Corda 4 node due to the lack of classloader isolation of attachment JARs (for example, all classloaded `.jar` files are visible to
all other classloaded `.jar` files). To maintain backwards compatibility, Corda 4 introduced a “classloader fallback mechanism” which attempts to
resolve and classload any referenced classes not found by the attachments classloader by scanning the applications classloader.




{{< warning >}}
The “classloader fallback mechanism” will be removed in a future version of Corda in favour of declarative dependency management,
whereby a Contract CorDapp will declare any dependencies on external classes in its own `.jar` file metadata (similar to module `requires`
declarations in [Java 9 modules](https://www.oracle.com/corporate/features/understanding-java-9-modules.html)).

{{< /warning >}}



### Example

CorDapps built using the new [Token SDK](https://github.com/corda/token-sdk) fall into this category, specifically any CorDapp that
extends the Token SDK `EvolvableTokenType` which is an abstract class that indirectly implements `Contract`. The `build.gradle`
file of the third-party Contract CorDapp should specify inclusive Token SDK CorDapp dependencies as follows:

```groovy
ext.tokens_sdk_release_group = 'com.r3.tokens-sdk'
ext.tokens_sdk_version = '1.0-SNAPSHOT'
...

dependencies {
    ...
    // Token SDK dependencies.
    compile "$tokens_sdk_release_group:contract:$tokens_sdk_version"
    compile "$tokens_sdk_release_group:money:$tokens_sdk_version"
    ...
}
```


* Workflow CorDapps.Please follow the instructions listed in step 5 of [Upgrading apps to Corda 4](app-upgrade-notes.md#cordapp-upgrade-finality-flow-ref).
