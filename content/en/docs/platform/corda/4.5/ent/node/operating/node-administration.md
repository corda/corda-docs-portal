# Node administration


## Logging

By default the node log files are stored to the `logs` subdirectory of the working directory and are rotated from time
to time. You can have logging printed to the console as well by passing the `--log-to-console` command line flag.
The default logging level is `INFO` which can be adjusted by the `--logging-level` command line argument. This configuration
option will affect all modules. Hibernate (the JPA provider used by Corda) specific log messages of level `WARN` and above
will be logged to the diagnostic log file, which is stored in the same location as other log files (`logs` subdirectory
by default). This is because Hibernate may log messages at WARN and ERROR that are handled internally by Corda and do not
need operator attention. If they do, they will be logged by Corda itself in the main node log file.

It may be the case that you require to amend the log level of a particular subset of modules (e.g., if you’d like to take a
closer look at hibernate activity). So, for more bespoke logging configuration, the logger settings can be completely overridden
with a [Log4j2](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x) configuration file assigned to the `log4j.configurationFile` system property.

Additionally, detailed logging around interactions with the database or HSM can be enabled by setting the `logging-level` to `TRACE` and will
be printed out in a separate file (name will be prefixed with *details*) in the same location as the other log files. This type of logging is better
structured to allow for log processing by 3rd party tools. MDC is also enabled for it. Currently, the following statement types are supported:


*
    * fields: *action*, *id*, *uploader*
    * actions: *loading*, *loaded*, *store_start*, *store_created*, *store_updated*, *query_start*, *query_end*, *query_version_start*, *query_version_end*


*
    * fields: *action*, *type*, *criteria*, *pagination*, *sorting*
    * actions: *query_start*, *query_end*


*
    * fields: *action*, *alias*, *scheme*, *found*, *algorithm*, *id*, *path*, *authState*
    * actions: *generate_key_pair_start*, *generate_key_pair_end*, *key_lookup_start*, *key_lookup_end*, *key_get_start*, *key_get_end*, *signing_start*, *signing_end*, *get_signer*, *create_client*, *key_import*, *authenticate_start*, *authenticate_end*, *keystore_load_start*, *keystore_load_end*


*
    * fields: *action*, *flowId*, *flow*, *state*, *flowState*, *subFlows*, *subFlowStack*, *exception*, *reason*, *error*, *suspends*, *session*, *errorState*, *numberOfSuspends*

```

The node is using log4j2 asynchronous logging by default (configured via log4j2 properties file in its resources)
to ensure that log message flushing is not slowing down the actual processing.
If you need to switch to synchronous logging (e.g. for debugging/testing purposes), you can override this behaviour
by adding `-DLog4jContextSelector=org.apache.logging.log4j.core.selector.ClassLoaderContextSelector` to the node’s
command line or to the `jvmArgs` section of the node configuration (see corda-configuration-file).
Additionally, you need to override the log4j2 configuration file by specifying `-Dlog4j.configurationFile=<log4j2 config>`.
The configuration file can be taken from the `config/dev` folder in [Corda Open Source repository](https://github.com/corda/corda).
When using synchronous logging with `RollingRandomAccessFile` appenders in the configuration file, make sure that they DO NOT
have `immediateFlush=false` setting.


{{< warning >}}
Ensure that `shutdownHook="disable"` is set if you are overriding the log4j2 configuration file
otherwise logs will not be flushed properly on shutdown and loss may occur. The option is set in the `Configuration`
tag of the log4j configuration file, for example `<Configuration ... shutdownHook="disable">`. This is because
Corda overrides the default log4j2 shutdown logic in order to make sure it gets shut down correctly.

{{< /warning >}}



### Example

Create a file `sql.xml` in the current working directory. Add the following text :

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <Configuration status="WARN">
        <Appenders>
            <Console name="Console" target="SYSTEM_OUT">
                <PatternLayout pattern="%d{HH:mm:ss.SSS} [%t] %-5level %logger{36} - %msg%n"/>
            </Console>
        </Appenders>
        <Loggers>
            <Logger name="org.hibernate" level="debug" additivity="false">
                <AppenderRef ref="Console"/>
            </Logger>
            <Root level="error">
                <AppenderRef ref="Console"/>
            </Root>
        </Loggers>
    </Configuration>
```

Note the addition of a logger named `org.hibernate` that has set this particular logger level to `debug`.

Now start the node as usual but with the additional parameter `log4j.configurationFile` set to the filename as above, e.g.

`java <Your existing startup options here> -Dlog4j.configurationFile=sql.xml -jar corda.jar`

To determine the name of the logger, for Corda objects, use the fully qualified name (e.g., to look at node output
in more detail, use `net.corda.node.internal.Node` although be aware that as we have marked this class `internal` we
reserve the right to move and rename it as it’s not part of the public API as yet). For other libraries, refer to their
logging name construction. If you can’t find what you need to refer to, use the `--logging-level` option as above and
then determine the logging module name from the console output.


## SSH access

Node can be configured to run SSH server. See [Node shell](shell.md) for details.


## Database access

When running a node backed with a H2 database, the node can be configured to expose the database over a socket
(see node-database-access-h2).

Note that in a production set up, it is highly recommended to use an enterprise grade database, and access to the
database should be via the usual database tools mechanisms, including access control and restrictions.


## Monitoring your node

This section covers monitoring performance and health of a node in Corda Enterprise with Jolokia and Graphite. General best practices for monitoring (e.g. setting up TCP checks for the ports the node communicates on, database health checks etc.) are not covered here but should be followed.



### Monitoring via Jolokia

Like most Java servers, the node can be configured to export various useful metrics and management operations via the industry-standard
[JMX infrastructure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Management_Extensions). JMX is a standard API
for registering so-called *MBeans* … objects whose properties and methods are intended for server management. As Java
serialization in the node has been restricted for security reasons, the metrics can only be exported via a Jolokia agent.

[Jolokia](https://jolokia.org/) allows you to access the raw data and operations without connecting to the JMX port
directly. Nodes can be configured to export the data over HTTP on the `/jolokia` HTTP endpoint, Jolokia defines the JSON and REST
formats for accessing MBeans, and provides client libraries to work with that protocol as well.

Here are a few ways to build dashboards and extract monitoring data for a node:


* [Hawtio](http://hawt.io) is a web based console that connects directly to JVM’s that have been instrumented with a
jolokia agent. This tool provides a nice JMX dashboard very similar to the traditional JVisualVM / JConsole MBbeans original.
* [JMX2Graphite](https://github.com/logzio/jmx2graphite) is a tool that can be pointed to /monitoring/json and will
scrape the statistics found there, then insert them into the Graphite monitoring tool on a regular basis. It runs
in Docker and can be started with a single command.
* [JMXTrans](https://github.com/jmxtrans/jmxtrans) is another tool for Graphite, this time, it’s got its own agent
(JVM plugin) which reads a custom config file and exports only the named data. It’s more configurable than
JMX2Graphite and doesn’t require a separate process, as the JVM will write directly to Graphite.
* Cloud metrics services like New Relic also understand JMX, typically, by providing their own agent that uploads the
data to their service on a regular schedule.
* [Telegraf](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf) is a tool to collect, process, aggregate, and write metrics.
It can bridge any data input to any output using their plugin system, for example, Telegraf can
be configured to collect data from Jolokia and write to DataDog web api.

In order to ensure that a Jolokia agent is instrumented with the JVM run-time, you can choose one of these options:


* Specify the Node configuration parameter `jmxMonitoringHttpPort` which will attempt to load the jolokia driver.
* Start the node with `java -Dcapsule.jvm.args="-javaagent:path/to/jolokia-jvm-{VERSION}-agent.jar=port=7777,host=localhost" -jar corda.jar` where `path/to/jolokia-jvm-{VERSION}-agent.jar` is the path to the driver, and `{VERSION}` is the version required by Corda, currently 1.6.1.

The following JMX statistics are exported:


* Corda specific metrics: see [Node metrics](../../node-metrics.md) for a list.
* Apache Artemis metrics: queue information for P2P and RPC services.
* JVM statistics: classloading, garbage collection, memory, runtime, threading, operating system.


### Notes for production use

When using Jolokia monitoring in production, it is recommended to use a Jolokia agent that reads the metrics from the node
and pushes them to the metrics storage, rather than exposing a port on the production machine/process to the internet.

Also ensure to have restrictive Jolokia access policy in place for access to production nodes. The Jolokia access is controlled
via a file called `jolokia-access.xml`.
Several Jolokia policy based security configuration files (`jolokia-access.xml`) are available for dev, test, and prod
environments under `/config/<env>`.

To pass a security policy use `java -Dcapsule.jvm.args=-javaagent:./drivers/jolokia-jvm-1.6.0-agent.jar,policyLocation=file:./config-path/jolokia-access.xml -jar corda.jar`


### Notes for development use

When running in dev mode, Hibernate statistics are also available via the Jolokia interface. These are disabled otherwise
due to expensive run-time costs. They can be turned on and off explicitly regardless of dev mode via the
`exportHibernateJMXStatistics` flag on the [database configuration](../setup/corda-configuration-file.md#database-properties-ref).

When starting Corda nodes using Cordformation runner (see running-a-node), you should see a startup message similar to the following:
**Jolokia: Agent started with URL http://127.0.0.1:7005/jolokia/**

When starting Corda nodes using the ‘driver DSL’, you should see a startup message in the logs similar to the following:
**Starting out-of-process Node USA Bank Corp, debug port is not enabled, Jolokia monitoring port is 7005 {}**

The following diagram illustrates Corda flow metrics visualized using hawtio:

![hawtio jmx](/en/images/hawtio-jmx.png "hawtio jmx")

### Monitoring via Graphite

Corda nodes alternatively support publishing metrics collected via the Codahale metrics library directly to a graphite
server. This needs to be configured in the node configuration file:

```kotlin
graphiteOptions = {
  prefix = "<node specific prefix>"
  server = <host name of the graphite server>
  port = <pickle receiver port on the graphite server>
}
```

The prefix should clearly indicate the node where the metrics are coming from, as this will be the top level discrimator in the graphite metric hierarchy.
The graphite server must be running with python pickle transport enabled. Please refer to the documentation on
[https://graphiteapp.org](https://graphiteapp.org) on how to install and run a graphite server.  Note that the default pickle receiver port on Graphite is 2004.



## Memory usage and tuning

All garbage collected programs can run faster if you give them more memory, as they need to collect less
frequently. As a default JVM will happily consume all the memory on your system if you let it, in *development mode* Corda is
configured with a 512mb Java heap by default. When other overheads are added, this yields
a total memory usage of about 800mb for a node (the overheads come from things like compiled code, metadata,
off-heap buffers, thread stacks, etc).

If you want to make your node go faster and profiling suggests excessive GC overhead is the cause, or if your
node is running out of memory, you can give it more by running the node like this:

`java -Dcapsule.jvm.args="-Xmx1024m" -jar corda.jar`

The example command above would give a 1 gigabyte Java heap.

{{< note >}}
When `devMode` is explicitly  <sup>[\[1\]](#node/operating/node-administration-id2) set to `false` the node memory size will be enlarged to 4G. This behaviour can be overridden by setting a custom memory size in the configuration file.

{{< /note >}}


<a name="node/operating/node-administration-id2"></a>

\[1\]
If `devMode` is not explicitly configured but resolved to `false` based on OS environment, the default heap size remains 512mb.


{{< note >}}
Unfortunately the JVM does not let you limit the total memory usage of Java program, just the heap size.

{{< /note >}}
A node which is running out of memory is expected to stop immediately to preserve ledger consistency and avoid flaws in operations.
Note that it’s a responsibility of a client application to handle RPC reconnection in case this happens. It’s also advised to have
necessary JVM monitoring and restart infrastructure in place.
See [Setting JVM arguments](../deploy/running-a-node.md#setting-jvm-args) for further details on JVM out-of-memory related parameters.



## Hiding sensitive data

A frequent requirement is that configuration files must not expose passwords to unauthorised readers. By leveraging environment variables, it is possible to hide passwords and other similar fields.

Take a simple node config that wishes to protect the node cryptographic stores:

```none
myLegalName = "O=PasswordProtectedNode,OU=corda,L=London,C=GB"
keyStorePassword = ${KEY_PASS}
trustStorePassword = ${TRUST_PASS}
p2pAddress = "localhost:12345"
devMode = false
networkServices {
    doormanURL = "https://cz.example.com"
    networkMapURL = "https://cz.example.com"
}
```

By delegating to a password store, and using *command substitution* it is possible to ensure that sensitive passwords never appear in plain text.
The below examples are of loading Corda with the KEY_PASS and TRUST_PASS variables read from a program named `corporatePasswordStore`.


### Bash

```shell
KEY_PASS=$(corporatePasswordStore --cordaKeyStorePassword) TRUST_PASS=$(corporatePasswordStore --cordaTrustStorePassword) java -jar corda.jar
```


{{< warning >}}
If this approach is taken, the passwords will appear in the shell history.

{{< /warning >}}



### Windows PowerShell

```shell
$env:KEY_PASS=$(corporatePasswordStore --cordaKeyStorePassword); $env:TRUST_PASS=$(corporatePasswordStore --cordaTrustStorePassword); java -jar corda.jar
```

For launching on Windows without PowerShell, it is not possible to perform command substitution, and so the variables must be specified manually, for example:

```shell
SET KEY_PASS=mypassword & SET TRUST_PASS=mypassword & java -jar corda.jar
```


{{< warning >}}
If this approach is taken, the passwords will appear in the windows command prompt history.

{{< /warning >}}



## Obfuscating sensitive data

Instead of hiding sensitive data using environment variables, another option is to use configuration obfuscation. Corda ships with a tools-config-obfuscator which allows the user to censor string properties in the configuration file. The config would look something like this:

```kotlin
keyStorePassword = "<{Kwby0G9c/+jxJM+c7Vaiow==:pdy+UaakdFSmmh8WWuBOoQ==}>"
trustStorePassword = "<{Kwby0G9c/+jxJM+c7Vaiow==:pdy+UaakdFSmmh8WWuBOoQ==}>"
p2pAddress = "localhost:12345"
devMode = false
```

The values for `keyStorePassword` and `trustStorePassword` in the above example are encrypted, using a key that is tied to the hosting machine’s primary hardware address. The implications of this is that:



* The configuration file is rendered unusable on other machines without manually decrypting obfuscated fields beforehand (since the hardware address would be different).
* Sensitive data is unreadable without additional processing.
* It becomes harder for adversaries to trawl for passwords and sensitive data on disk.



{{< warning >}}
This method does not offer full protection. An adversary who knows the intrinsics of the obfuscation method used, can still decipher the sensitive bits.

{{< /warning >}}




## Backup recommendations

Various components of the Corda platform read their configuration from the file system, and persist data to a database or into files on disk.
Given that hardware can fail, operators of IT infrastructure must have a sound backup strategy in place. Whilst blockchain platforms can sometimes recover some lost data from their peers, it is rarely the case that a node can recover its full state in this way because real-world blockchain applications invariably contain private information (e.g., customer account information). Moreover, this private information must remain in sync with the ledger state. As such, we strongly recommend implementing a comprehensive backup strategy.

The following elements of a backup strategy are recommended:


### Database replication

When properly configured, database replication prevents data loss from occurring in case the database host fails.
In general, the higher the number of replicas, and the further away they are deployed in terms of regions and availability zones, the more a setup is resilient to disasters.
The trade-off is that, ideally, replication should happen synchronously, meaning that a high number of replicas and a considerable network latency will impact the performance of the Corda nodes connecting to the cluster.
Synchronous replication is strongly advised to prevent data loss.


### Database snapshots

Database replication is a powerful technique, but it is very sensitive to destructive SQL updates. Whether malicious or unintentional, a SQL statement might compromise data by getting propagated to all replicas.
Without rolling snapshots, data loss due to such destructive updates will be irreversible.
Using snapshots always implies some data loss in case of a disaster, and the trade-off is between highly frequent backups minimising such a loss, and less frequent backups consuming less resources.
At present, Corda does not offer online updates with regards to transactions.
Should states in the vault ever be lost, partial or total recovery might be achieved by asking third-party companies and/or notaries to provide all data relevant to the affected legal identity.


### File backups

Corda components read and write information from and to the file-system. The advice is to backup the entire root directory of the component, plus any external directories and files optionally specified in the configuration.
Corda assumes the filesystem is reliable. You must ensure that it is configured to provide this assurance, which means you must configure it to synchronously replicate to your backup/DR site.
If the above holds, Corda components will benefit from the following:


* Guaranteed eventual processing of acknowledged client messages, provided that the backlog of persistent queues is not lost irremediably.
* A timely recovery from deletion or corruption of configuration files (e.g., `node.conf`, `node-info` files, etc.), database drivers, CorDapps binaries and configuration, and certificate directories, provided backups are available to restore from.


{{< warning >}}
Private keys used to sign transactions should be preserved with the utmost care. The recommendation is to keep at least two separate copies on a storage not connected to the Internet.

{{< /warning >}}



## Checking node version and installed CorDapps

A `nodeDiagnosticInfo` RPC call can be made to obtain version information about the Corda platform running on the node. The returned `NodeDiagnosticInfo` object also includes information about the CorDapps installed on the node.
The RPC call is also available as the `run nodeDiagnosticInfo` command executable from the Corda shell that can be accessed via the local terminal, SSH, or as the standalone shell.


### Example

Here is a sample output displayed by the `run nodeDiagnosticInfo` command executed from the Corda shell:

```none

```


## Managing trusted attachments

The node comes equipped with tools to manage attachments, including tooling to examine installed and uploaded attachments as well as those
that were received over the network.

{{< note >}}
A Contract CorDapp (an attachment) received over the network, is only allowed to be evaluated if there are other Contract
CorDapps installed in the node that have been signed by at least one of the received CorDapp’s keys.

See [Signature Constraints](../../cordapps/api-contract-constraints.md#signature-constraints) and
[Signing CorDapps for use with Signature Constraints](../../cordapps/api-contract-constraints.md#signing-cordapps-for-use-with-signature-constraints) for more information

{{< /note >}}

### Shell commands

The following shell command can be used to extract information about attachments from the node:



* `attachments trustInfo`

Outputs to the shell a list of all attachments along with the following information:



* Whether an attachment is installed locally>

    * `True` if the attachment is installed in the CorDapps directory or uploaded via RPC
    * `False` in all other scenarios, including attachments received from a peer node or uploaded via any means other than RPC



* If an attachment is trusted
* Which other attachment, if any, provided trust to an attachment


Below is an example out the command’s output:

```none

The `Name` column will be empty if the attachment has been stored without a name. `Trust Root` will also display an attachment
hash if there is no name to display.

The output above shows that two CorDapps have been installed locally and are therefore trusted. The 3rd record is an attachment received
from another node, hence the `Name` field containing `Received from: O=PartyA, L=London, C=GB`. The CorDapp is also trusted as another
CorDapp has been signed by a common key, the `Trust Root` field is filled in to highlight this.
