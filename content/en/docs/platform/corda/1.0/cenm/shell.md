# Embedded Shell


The embedded shell allows an administrator to control and monitor the Network Management service being run (Network Map,
Doorman or Revocation service). It is based on the [CRaSH](http://www.crashub.org/) shell and provides certain functions such as viewing the
current state of the network (via the Network Map shell) or viewing the CSRs awaiting approval (via the Doorman shell).



## Shell Configuration

The optional `shell` configuration block can be added to the given Network Management service configuration file to
enable the embedded shell. There are two modes that the shell can run in:


### Local Mode

The service can be configured to boot straight into the local shell upon startup by setting the
`shell.localShell` optional configuration parameter to be true:

```guess
...
shell {
    localShell = true
}
...
```


### SSH Mode

A more versatile method to access the shell is via SSH. This can be configured by specifying the port, user and
password within the `shell` configuration block:

```guess
...
shell {
    sshdPort = <PORT>
    user = <USERNAME>
    password = <PASSWORD>
}
...
```


## SSH Authentication

The host key is loaded from the `<BASE_DIRECTORY>/sshkey/hostkey.pem` file, where <BASE_DIRECTORY> corresponds to the
directory that the service is being run from. This can be overloaded with the `shell.sshHostKeyDirectory` config
parameter option. If this file does not exist, it is generated automatically.


## Connecting to the shell via SSH

For Linux/Mac OS user, the following commands can be run from the terminal:

```bash
ssh -p [portNumber] [host] -l [user]
```

Where:


* `[portNumber]` is the port number specified by the `shell.sshdPort` config parameter
* `[host]` is the serviceâ€™s host (e.g. `localhost` if running the service locally)
* `[user]` is the username specified by the `shell.user` config parameter

The password will be requested after a connection is established.

{{< note >}}
Restarting the service frequently may cause the host key to be regenerated. SSH usually saves
trusted hosts and will refuse to connect in case of a change. This check can be disabled using the
`-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no` flag. This option should never be used in production environment!

## Supported Commands

The top level list of available commands can be seen by executing `help` from the shell. There are currently two types
of commands:


* `view` - Commands relating to viewing properties and states relating to the current service.
* `run` - Commands that interact with the service and change the state in some manner.

The list of available commands in each subsection can be viewed by executing either `view` or `run` from the shell.
A shell command can by run by executing the type of the command followed by the command name
(`[view|run] <COMMAND_NAME>`). For example, to view all notaries within the Network Map service:

```bash
view notaries
```

More information, including an command line example, for each command can be acquired by using the built-in `man`
functionality (`man <COMMAND_NAME>`). For example, to find out more about the view all notaries command listed above:

```bash
man notaries
```
