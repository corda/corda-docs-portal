# Posting transactions to observer nodes

This tutorial will take you through the steps involved in adding support for observer nodes to your CorDapp.

## Introduction

Posting transactions to an observer node is a common requirement in finance, where regulators often want
to receive comprehensive reporting on all actions taken. By running their own node, regulators can receive a stream
of digitally signed, de-duplicated reports useful for later processing.

## Adding support for observer nodes

Adding support for observer nodes to your application is easy. The Trade reporting demo ([Kotlin](https://github.com/corda/samples-kotlin/tree/master/Features/observableStates-tradereporting), [Java](https://github.com/corda/samples-java/tree/master/Features/observablestates-tradereporting)) shows how to do so.

## How observer nodes operate

* By default, vault queries do not differentiate between states you recorded as a participant/owner, and states you
recorded as an observer. You will have to write custom vault queries that only return states for which you are a
participant/owner. See the [Example usage](api-vault-query.md#example-usage) section of the [API: Vault Query](api-vault-query.md) page for information on how to do this.
This also means that `Cash.generateSpend` should not be used when recording `Cash.State` states as an observer.

* When an observer node is sent a transaction with the `ALL_VISIBLE` flag set, any transactions in the transaction history
that have not already been received will also have `ALL_VISIBLE` states recorded. This mean a node that is both an observer
and a participant may have some transactions with all states recorded and some with only relevant states recorded, even
if those transactions are part of the same chain. As a result, there may be more states present in the vault than would be
expected if just those transactions sent with the `ALL_VISIBLE` recording flag were processed in this way.

* Nodes may re-record transactions if they have previously recorded them as a participant and wish to record them as an observer. However,  if this is done,
the node cannot resolve a forward chain of transactions. This means that if you wish to re-record a chain of transactions
and get the new output states to be correctly marked as consumed, the full chain must be sent to the node *in order*.
