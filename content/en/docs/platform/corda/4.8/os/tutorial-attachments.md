# Working with attachments

This tutorial outlines how to work with attachments, also known as contract attachments.

## Introduction

Attachments are ZIP/JAR files referenced from transaction by hash, but not included in the transaction
itself. These files are automatically requested from the node sending the transaction when needed and cached
locally so they are not re-requested if encountered again. Attachments typically contain:

* Contract code
* Metadata about a transaction, such as PDF version of an invoice being settled
* Shared information to be permanently recorded on the ledger

## Uploading and downloading attachments

To add attachments, the file must first be uploaded to the node, which returns a unique ID that can be added
using `TransactionBuilder.addAttachment()`.

It is encouraged that, where possible, attachments are reusable data, so that nodes can meaningfully cache them.

### Uploading an attachment

To upload an attachment to the node, you need to first connect to the relevant node. You can do this via the Corda RPC Client, as described in [Interacting with a node](clientrpc.md) or you can upload your attachment via the [Node shell](shell.md).

To upload an attachment, run the following command:

```
run uploadAttachment jar: <insert path-to-the-file>.jar
```

Alternatively, if you want to include the metadata with the attachment which can be used to find it later on, run the following command:

```
run uploadAttachmentWithMetadata jar: path/to/the/file.jar, uploader: myself, filename: original_name.jar
```

Note that currently both uploader and filename are just plain strings - there is no connection between uploader and the RPC users, for example).

The file is uploaded, checked and if successful the hash of the file is returned. This is how the attachment is
identified inside the node.

### Downloading an attachment

To download an attachment named by its hash, you need to first connect to the relevant node. You can do this via the Corda RPC Client, as described in [Interacting with a node](clientrpc.md) or you can upload your attachment via the [Node shell](shell.md).

To download an attachment, run the following command, replacing the ID with the hash of the attachment that you want to download:

```
run openAttachment id: AB7FED7663A3F195A59A0F01091932B15C22405CB727A1518418BF53C6E6663A
```

You will be prompted to provide a path to save the file to. To do the same thing programmatically, you
can pass a simple `InputStream` or `SecureHash` to the `uploadAttachment`/`openAttachment` RPCs from
a JVM client.


## Searching for attachments

Attachment metadata can be queried in a similar way to the vault (see [API: Vault Query](api-vault-query.md)).

`AttachmentQueryCriteria` can be used to build a query using the following set of column operations:

* Binary logical (`AND`, `OR`)
* Comparison (`LESS_THAN`, `LESS_THAN_OR_EQUAL`, `GREATER_THAN`, `GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL`)
* Equality (`EQUAL`, `NOT_EQUAL`)
* Likeness (`LIKE`, `NOT_LIKE`)
* Nullability (`IS_NULL`, `NOT_NULL`)
* Collection based (`IN`, `NOT_IN`)

The `and` and `or` operators can be used to build complex queries. For example:

{{< tabs name="tabs-1" >}}
{{% tab name="kotlin" %}}
```kotlin

attachmentStorage.queryAttachments(
    AttachmentsQueryCriteria(uploaderCondition = Builder.equal("alice"))
        .and(AttachmentsQueryCriteria(uploaderCondition = Builder.equal("bob")))
)
​
attachmentStorage.queryAttachments(
    AttachmentsQueryCriteria(uploaderCondition = Builder.equal("alice"))
        .or(AttachmentsQueryCriteria(uploaderCondition = Builder.equal("bob")))

```
{{% /tab %}}

{{% tab name="java" %}}
```java

attachmentStorage.queryAttachments(
    new AttachmentsQueryCriteria(Builder.INSTANCE.equal("alice"))
    .and(new AttachmentsQueryCriteria(Builder.INSTANCE.equal("bob")))
);
​
attachmentStorage.queryAttachments(
    new AttachmentsQueryCriteria(Builder.INSTANCE.equal("alice"))
        .or(new AttachmentsQueryCriteria(Builder.INSTANCE.equal("bob")))
);
```

## Fetching attachments

Normally, attachments on transactions are fetched automatically via the `ReceiveTransactionFlow`. Attachments
are needed in order to validate a transaction (they include, for example, the contract code), so must be fetched
before the validation process can run.

{{< note >}}
Future versions of Corda may support non-critical attachments that are not used for transaction verification
and which are shared explicitly. These are useful for attaching and signing auditing data with a transaction
that isn’t used as part of the contract logic.

## Example

Here is a simple example of how to attach a file to a transaction and send it to the counterparty. The full code for this demo can be found in the [Kotlin](https://github.com/corda/samples-kotlin/tree/master/Features/attachment-sendfile) and [Java](https://github.com/corda/samples-java/tree/master/Features/attachment-sendfile) sample repositories.
