# Business Network Operator project planning

When planning a Corda deployment as a Business Network Operator, there are several considerations:

- Deployment environments
- Notary compatibility
- HSM compatibility
- Database compatibility
- Corda Enterprise Network Manager deployment

The Business Network Operator is responsible for all major components of the Corda network. In most enterprise deployments
of Corda this includes: Nodes, an HA notary cluster, an HA Corda Firewall, an HSM, the certificate hierarchy of the network,
identity manager, and network map.

This likely includes a Corda Enterprise Network Manager as well as Corda Enterprise.

## Deployment environments

Business Network Operators will need several deployments of Corda Enterprise, at least including:

- A development environment including minimal network infrastructure.
- A testing environment including a basic network, without HA notary, Corda Firewall, or HSMs.
- A UAT environment, that includes the full network infrastructure, with a shared HSM, and HA Corda Firewall.
- The production environment, including an HA notary cluster, HA Corda Firewalls on all nodes, HSMs, and network services.

## Node sizing and databases

When defining the requirements of a node, it is important to define the resources that the node will require. While every
Corda deployment will have different requirements - depending on the CorDapps and business model of the parties - the
following table gives approximate sizings for typical node deployments.

{{< table >}}

|Size|JVM Heap|#Â Cores|Minimum Host RAM|
|------------|---------|-------|----------------|
|Small|1GB|1|2GB to 3GB|
|Medium|4GB|8|8GB|
|Large|32GB|32|64GB|
|X-Large|> 32GB|> 32|> 64GB|

All Corda Nodes have a database. A range of third-party databases are supported by Corda, shown in the following table:
