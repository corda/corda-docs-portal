# What is a CorDapp?

CorDapps (Corda Distributed Applications) are distributed applications that run on the Corda platform. The goal of a
CorDapp is to allow nodes to reach agreement on updates to the ledger. They achieve this goal by defining flows that
Corda node owners can invoke over RPC:

When designing your CorDapp, you may want to consider using the [CorDapp Design Language](/docs/cdl/cdl/cdl-overview) to structure and organise your designs. This can be especially helpful for complex CorDapps.

## CorDapp components

CorDapps take the form of a set of JAR files containing class definitions written in Java and/or Kotlin.

These class definitions will commonly include the following elements:


* Flows: Define a routine for the node to run, usually to update the ledger
(see [Key Concepts - Flows](key-concepts-flows.md)). They subclass `FlowLogic`
* States: Define the facts over which agreement is reached (see [Key Concepts - States](key-concepts-states.md)).
They implement the `ContractState` interface
* Contracts, defining what constitutes a valid ledger update (see
[Key Concepts - Contracts](key-concepts-contracts.md)). They implement the `Contract` interface
* Services, providing long-lived utilities within the node. They subclass `SingletonSerializationToken`
* Serialisation whitelists, restricting what types your node will receive off the wire. They implement the
`SerializationWhitelist` interface

But the CorDapp JAR can also include other class definitions. These may include:


* APIs and static web content
* Utility classes


## An example

Suppose a node owner wants their node to be able to trade bonds. They may choose to install a Bond Trading CorDapp with
the following components:


* A `BondState`, used to represent bonds as shared facts on the ledger
* A `BondContract`, used to govern which ledger updates involving `BondState` states are valid
* Three flows:

    * An `IssueBondFlow`, allowing new `BondState` states to be issued onto the ledger
    * A `TradeBondFlow`, allowing existing `BondState` states to be bought and sold on the ledger
    * An `ExitBondFlow`, allowing existing `BondState` states to be exited from the ledger




After installing this CorDapp, the node owner will be able to use the flows defined by the CorDapp to agree ledger
updates related to issuance, sale, purchase and exit of bonds.


## Writing and building apps that run on both Corda (open source) and Corda Enterprise

Corda and Corda Enterprise are compatible and interoperable, which means you can write a CorDapp that can run on both.
To make this work in practice you should follow these steps:


* Ensure your CorDapp is designed per [Structuring a CorDapp](writing-a-cordapp.md) and annotated according to [CorDapp separation](cordapp-build-systems.md#cordapp-separation-ref).
In particular, it is critical to separate the consensus-critical parts of your application (contracts, states and their dependencies) from
the rest of the business logic (flows, APIs, etc).
The former - the **CorDapp kernel** - is the Jar that will be attached to transactions creating/consuming your states and is the Jar
that any node on the network verifying the transaction must execute.

{{< note >}}
It is also important to understand how to manage any dependencies a CorDapp may have on 3rd party libraries and other CorDapps.
Please read [Setting your dependencies](cordapp-build-systems.md#cordapp-dependencies-ref) to understand the options and recommendations with regards to correctly Jarâ€™ing CorDapp dependencies.

{{< /note >}}

* Compile this **CorDapp kernel** Jar once, and then depend on it from your workflows Jar (or Jars - see below). Importantly, if
you want your app to work on both Corda and Corda Enterprise, you must compile this Jar against Corda, not Corda Enterprise.
This is because, in future, we may add additional functionality to Corda Enterprise that is not in Corda and you may inadvertently create a
CorDapp kernel that does not work on Corda open source. Compiling against Corda open source as a matter of course prevents this risk, as well
as preventing the risk that you inadvertently create two different versions of the Jar, which will have different hashes and hence break compatibility
and interoperability.

{{< note >}}
As of Corda 4 it is recommended to use [CorDapp Jar signing](cordapp-build-systems.md#cordapp-build-system-signing-cordapp-jar-ref) to leverage the new signature constraints functionality.

{{< /note >}}

* Your workflow Jar(s) should depend on the **CorDapp kernel** (contract, states and dependencies). Importantly, you can create different workflow
Jars for Corda and Corda Enterprise, because the workflows Jar is not consensus critical. For example, you may wish to add additional features
to your CorDapp for when it is run on Corda Enterprise (perhaps it uses advanced features of one of the supported enterprise databases or includes
advanced database migration scripts, or some other Enterprise-only feature).

In summary, structure your app as kernel (contracts, states, dependencies) and workflow (the rest) and be sure to compile the kernel
against Corda open source. You can compile your workflow (Jars) against the distribution of Corda that they target.
