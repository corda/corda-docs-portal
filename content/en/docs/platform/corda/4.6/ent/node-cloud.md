# Corda Enterprise cloud images

Corda Enteprise is avaliable as a Virtual Machine image on AWS and Azure.
These are simple Linux VM images with a JDK supported by both cloud providers and Corda Enterprise.
Alongside the Corda Enterprise JAR the image contains an example `node.conf` file and `dbconfig.conf` file for H2 DB.
There is also the systemd service (called `corda`) ready to use.


## Corda Enterprise for Azure

{{< note >}}
Corda Enterprise for Azure is based on Ubuntu Linux and has Azul Enterprise OpenJDK installed.

{{< /note >}}
Follow the standard Azure procedure to create a VM.
You can find more details at the Azure docs site: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/).
Please select a VM type with more than 4GB of memory.

When the machine is ready, please log in to it using the credentials provided during deployment.

Next, change the session user to `corda` (alternatively, change the user to `root` to gain administrator privileges):

```shell
sudo -u corda bash
```

Go to the Corda installation directory:

```shell
cd /opt/corda/current
```

Review and adjust the content of the configuration files to your needs.
The main configuration file is the `node.conf` file and database specific configuration is stored in the `dbconfig.conf` file.
All Corda configuration parameters are described in corda-configuration-file.
Remember to adjust the `p2paddress` to match a FQDN or the public IP address of the VM.
The public IP address can be obtained from the shell using the following command:

```shell
curl -H Metadata:true http://169.254.169.254/metadata/instance?api-version=2017-04-02| jq '.network.interface[0].ipv4.ipAddress[0].publicIpAddress'
```

Note that only the p2p port (10002) is opened by default in a Network Security Group attached to the VM.
To enable RPC communication from a remote machine the firewall has to be adjusted.

For proudction usage, copy the required database drivers (e.g. Azure DB) into the `drivers` directory.
More information on database configuration can be found at node-database

Copy the selected CorDapps into the cordapps directory and their configuration to the `cordapps/config` subdirectory.

Copy the network root trust store for a Corda network you plan to join into the `certificates` directory.

Start the initial registration process with:

```shell
java -jar corda.jar initial-registration -p <PASSWORD_FOR_NETWORK_ROOT_TRUSTORE>
```

After the node has registered, verify that all files in the `/opt/corda/current` directory (and its subdirectories) are owned by the `corda` user.
Then the systemd `corda` service can be started.

```shell
exit #to leave corda user shell
sudo chown -R corda:corda /opt/corda/current # to change file ownership
sudo systemctl start corda
```

You can check the status of the `corda` service by running:

```shell
sudo systemctl status corda
```


## Corda Enterprise for AWS

{{< note >}}
Corda Enterprise for AWS is based on Amazon Linux 2 and has Corretto JDK installed.

{{< /note >}}
Follow the standard AWS procedure to install VM.
You can find more details at the AWS docs site: [https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/tutorials/launch-a-virtual-machine/](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/tutorials/launch-a-virtual-machine/).
Please select a VM type with more than 4GB of memory.

When the machine is ready, please log in to it using the credentials provided during deployment.

Next, change the session user to `corda` (alternatively, change the user to `root` to gain administrator privileges):

```shell
sudo -u corda bash
```

```shell
cd /opt/corda/current
```

All Corda configuration parameters are described in corda-configuration-file.
Remember to adjust the `p2paddress` to match a FQDN or the public IP address of the VM.
The public IP address can be obtained from the shell using the following command:

```shell
curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-ipv4
```

Note that only the p2p port (10002) is opened by default in a Security Group attached to the VM.
To enable RPC communication from a remote machine the firewall has to be adjusted.

For proudction usage, copy the required database drivers into the `drivers` directory.

```shell
java -jar corda.jar initial-registration -p <PASSWORD_FOR_NETWORK_ROOT_TRUSTORE>
```

After the node has registered, verify that all files in the `/opt/corda/current` directory (and its subdirectories) are owned by the `corda` user.
Then the systemd `corda` service can be started.

```shell
exit #to leave corda user shell
sudo chown -R corda:corda /opt/corda/current # to change file ownership
sudo systemctl start corda
```

You can check the status of the `corda` service by running:

```shell
sudo systemctl status corda
```
