# Featured apps

These early-version apps allow you to explore new possibilities on Corda. You can use them to carry out trial development work, and refine your vision for developing on Corda.

Within the documentation, you will find set-up guides, tips, and operational instructions for a growing list of applications made for exploration and very early adoption.

* [State reissuance](../en/apps/reissuance/state-reissuance.md) - A mechanism for breaking transaction backchains by reissuing a state with a guaranteed state replacement.
