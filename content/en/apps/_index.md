# Featured apps

These early-version apps allow you to explore new possibilities on Corda. You can use them to carry out trial development work, and refine your vision for developing on Corda.

Within the documentation, you will find set-up guides, tips, and operational instructions for a growing list of applications made for exploration and very early adoption.

Explore:

* [Bank in a Box](./bankinabox/getting-started) - a complete retail banking concept that can be hosted on a Corda network.
* [Corda Payments Alpha](./payments/payments-index) - early sight of the possibilities of making payments in and out of a Corda network.
* [State reissuance](./state-reissuance.md).
