# Admin user interface

The admin user interface of Bank in a Box allows an admin user to perform the tasks of a bank employee. Read on to familiarise yourself with the elements of the user interface. To learn how to perform tasks as an admin user, see the [How to guide](how-to.md#admin-tasks).

## Log in and home screen

When you have successfully started the Bank in a Box user interface, you will be prompted to log in with username and password.

The default Admin user name and password are as follows:

* User name: admin
* Password: password1!

After entering the admin username and password, you will arrive at the home screen. From the left sidebar navigation, you can access different screens depending on your role (Admin or Customer).

{{< note >}}
Although this application should not be used in production, you must change the admin password after the initial login.

Follow these steps to do so:

1. Create a secure raw password following best practices.
2. Encrypt the raw password using [bcrypt](https://auth0.com/blog/hashing-in-action-understanding-bcrypt/).
3. Add the encrypted password to this line in the database: [https://github.com/corda/bank-in-a-box/blob/release/bankinabox/1.0/clients/src/main/resources/db/changelog/user-schema-dml-v1.changelog.xml#L21](https://github.com/corda/bank-in-a-box/blob/release/bankinabox/1.0/clients/src/main/resources/db/changelog/user-schema-dml-v1.changelog.xml#L21) .
