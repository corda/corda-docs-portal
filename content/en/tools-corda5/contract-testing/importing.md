## Adding the Framework as a Dependency

To use the framework with your CorDapp, add the following dependency to the `build.gradle` file:

```gradle
dependencies {
    testImplementation 'com.r3.corda.ledger.utxo:contract-testing:2.0.0'
}
```

If your CorDapp is written in Kotlin, you can also add a Kotlin DSL framework, as follows:
```gradle
dependencies {
    testImplementation 'com.r3.corda.ledger.utxo:contract-testing:2.0.0'
    testImplementation 'com.r3.corda.ledger.utxo:contract-testing-kotlin:2.0.0'
}
```

You can now extend the `ContractTest` interface to create a test class for your smart contracts. Your contract test classes must inherit from the `ContractTest` base class, as follows:

```kotlin
class ExampleIdentifiableContractCreateCommandTests : ContractTest() {
    ...
}
```

## Testing with the Framework

All tests should extend `ContractTest` as a starting point. The `ContractTest` class provides functions to easily write contract tests, the `UTXOLedgerService` and `MockSigningService` classes, and also the following useful test data:

<style>
table th:first-of-type {
    width: 40%;
}
table th:nth-of-type(2) {
    width: 60%;
}
</style>
