# Contract Testing Framework

The Contract Testing framework enables CorDapp developers to test smart contracts locally at an early stage of the development cycle, without having to deploy a Corda network. With this framework, you can check that your CorDapp contracts behave as expected before, or after, you write the flows.

{{< note >}}
This version of the Contract Testing framework only supports UTXO contracts.
