# Overheard by writers

In this section, the Technical Writing Team at R3 (also known as 'The Best Team' - all tech writes reserved!) will keep you in the know about what's new in the docs.

We'll also share exciting and important news, announcements, and security advisories relating to R3 products and releases.

## CordaCon 2021!

**28th September 2021**

R3’s flagship conference is back—and this year it's hybrid!

This year's theme is **Digital trust, delivered**. CordaCon 2021 will focus on the benefits of trust technology, and approaches to connecting networks and ecosystems in regulated markets.

Head over to the <a href="https://www.cordacon.com/" target="_blank">CordaCon 2021 website</a>  to register and view the agenda!

## The docs have a new home

**28th September 2021**

The entire R3 documentation has moved home - **doc.r3.com** - and you are already in!

Welcome to the palace of Corda knowledge - the single source of truth for everything you need to know about Corda!

Alongside the brand new site design and the user experience perks it brings, we have made a few more significant changes in the background. To name a few:

* We have massively refactored the entire documentation sets for Corda 4.8 (open source), Corda Enterprise 4.8, and Corda Enterprise Network Manager (CENM) 1.5! The work on this project will continue for a little longer in the next few months, however we truly hope that this content is now more readable, better structured, and overall much more useful and easier to follow than before.
* We have brought over the complete API documentation reference content to [docs.r3.com](https://docs.r3.com/en/api-ref.html), and we have added the Corda 5 Developer Preview public API reference too.
* In the near future we are planning to improve the Conclave documentation content and migrate it to [doc.r3.com](https://docs.r3.com).
* We have added **dark mode** to the docs - just click the icon at the top right corner of any docs page!
* We plan to expand the scope of the content we pubish on [doc.r3.com](https://docs.r3.com). In the upcoming year, we will be bringing you more useful tutorials, enriched and improved content based on your feedback and our own user research and analytics, and more interactive learning paths to support the main documentation.

Tell us what you think about the docs and the new site on <a href="https://cordaledger.slack.com/archives/C01Q3RQ7E8M">slack</a> and <a href="mailto:corda-docs@r3.com">over email</a>.
