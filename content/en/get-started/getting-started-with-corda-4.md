# Get started with Corda 4

## Get started with Corda 4.8 (open source)

The best way to get started with Corda is to:
1. Familiarize yourself with the [Corda key concepts](./corda-key-concepts.md).
2. Run an [example CorDapp](../tutorials/corda/4.8/os/template-tutorial/writing-a-cordapp-using-a-template.md) to see Corda in action.
3. [Build your own CorDapp](../tutorials/corda/4.8/os/build-basic-cordapp/basic-cordapp-intro.md) from scratch.

Then, you can take your Corda integration to the next level by deep-diving into specific topics in our [Corda 4 core documentation set][../platform/corda/4.8/open-source.html], viewing the [API reference material](../api-ref.html), or browsing [featured apps](../apps.html) and [tools and add-ons](../tools.html).
