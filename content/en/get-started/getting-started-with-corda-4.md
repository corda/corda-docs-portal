# Getting started with Corda 4

The best way to get started with Corda is to:
1. Decide whether you need to use:
   * Corda Enterprise - the enterprise version of Corda, for which you require a commercial contract with R3.
   * Corda open source - the open source version of Corda, which you can build on now.
   Jump to: [Corda](../platform/corda/4.8/open-source/_index.md) or [Corda Enterprise](../platform/corda/4.8/enterprise/_index.md).
2. Familiarize yourself with the [Corda key concepts](./corda-key-concepts.md).
3. Run a [sample CorDapp](../tutorials/corda/4.8/os/template-tutorial/writing-a-cordapp-using-a-template.md) to see Corda in action.
4. [Build your own CorDapp](../tutorials/corda/4.8/os/build-basic-cordapp/basic-cordapp-intro.md) from scratch.

Then, you can take your Corda integration to the next level by deep-diving into specific topics in our [Corda 4 core documentation set](../platform/corda/4.8/open-source.html), viewing the [API reference material](../api-ref.html), or browsing [featured apps](../apps.html) and [tools and add-ons](../tools.html).

<b>Read the Corda white papers</b>
* The [introductory white paper](https://www.r3.com/white-papers/the-corda-platform-an-introduction-whitepaper/) describes Corda’s mission and philosophy. It’s suitable for a business audience.
* The [technical white paper](https://www.r3.com/white-papers/corda-technical-whitepaper/) describes the architecture and protocol.

## Getting started with Corda Enterprise Network Manager (CENM) 1.5

Before you deploy [CENM](../platform/corda/1.5/cenm/_index.md), read about [Corda networks](../platform/corda/1.5/cenm/corda-networks.md) and the [components of CENM](../platform/corda/1.5/cenm/enm-components.md).

For instructions on deploying:
* CENM with Docker, Kubernetes, and Helm charts, see [CENM Deployment with Docker, Kubernetes, and Helm charts](../platform/corda/1.5/cenm/deployment-kubernetes.md).
* CENM with Amazon Web Services (AWS), see [CENM Deployment on AWS](../platform/corda/1.5/cenm/aws-deployment-guide.md).
* CENM services as a test environment, see the [CENM test environment quick start guide](../platform/corda/1.5/cenm/quick-start.md).
