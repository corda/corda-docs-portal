# Deterministic Corda Modules

A Corda contract’s verify function should always produce the same results for the same input data. To that end,
Corda provides the following modules:



* `core-deterministic`
* `serialization-deterministic`
* `jdk8u-deterministic`


These are reduced version of Corda’s `core` and `serialization` modules and the OpenJDK 8 `rt.jar`, where the
non-deterministic functionality has been removed. The intention here is that all CorDapp classes required for
contract verification should be compiled against these modules to prevent them containing non-deterministic behaviour.

{{< note >}}
These modules are only a development aid. They cannot guarantee determinism without also including
deterministic versions of all their dependent libraries, e.g. `kotlin-stdlib`.

{{< /note >}}

## Generating the Deterministic Modules

`jdk8u-deterministic` is a “pseudo JDK” image that we can point the Java and Kotlin compilers to. It downloads the
`rt.jar` containing a deterministic subset of the Java 8 APIs from the Artifactory.To build a new version of this JAR and upload it to the Artifactory, see the `create-jdk8u` module. This is a
standalone Gradle project within the Corda repository that will clone the `deterministic-jvm8` branch of Corda’s
[OpenJDK repository](https://github.com/corda/openjdk) and then build it. (This currently requires a C++ compiler,
GNU Make and a UNIX-like development environment.)`core-deterministic` and `serialization-deterministic` are generated from Corda’s `core` and `serialization`
modules respectively using both [ProGuard](https://www.guardsquare.com/en/proguard) and Corda’s `JarFilter` Gradle
plugin. Corda developers configure these tools by applying Corda’s `@KeepForDJVM` and `@DeleteForDJVM`
annotations to elements of `core` and `serialization` as described [here](#deterministic-annotations).The build generates each of Corda’s deterministic JARs in six steps:



* Some *very few* classes in the original JAR must be replaced completely. This is typically because the original
class uses something like `ThreadLocal`, which is not available in the deterministic Java APIs, and yet the
class is still required by the deterministic JAR. We must keep such classes to a minimum!
* The patched JAR is analysed by ProGuard for the first time using the following rule:

```groovy
keep '@interface net.corda.core.KeepForDJVM { *; }'
```



ProGuard works by calculating how much code is reachable from given “entry points”, and in our case these entry
points are the `@KeepForDJVM` classes. The unreachable classes are then discarded by ProGuard’s `shrink`
option.
* The remaining classes may still contain non-deterministic code. However, there is no way of writing a ProGuard rule
explicitly to discard anything. Consider the following class:

```kotlin
@CordaSerializable
@KeepForDJVM
data class UniqueIdentifier @JvmOverloads @DeleteForDJVM constructor(
    val externalId: String? = null,
    val id: UUID = UUID.randomUUID()
) : Comparable<UniqueIdentifier> {
    ...
}
```



While CorDapps will definitely need to handle `UniqueIdentifier` objects, all of the secondary constructors
generate a new random `UUID` and so are non-deterministic. Hence the next “determinising” step is to pass the
classes to the `JarFilter` tool, which strips out all of the elements which have been annotated as
`@DeleteForDJVM` and stubs out any functions annotated with `@StubOutForDJVM`. (Stub functions that
return a value will throw `UnsupportedOperationException`, whereas `void` or `Unit` stubs will do nothing.)
* After the `@DeleteForDJVM` elements have been filtered out, the classes are rescanned using ProGuard to remove
any more code that has now become unreachable.
* The remaining classes define our deterministic subset. However, the `@kotlin.Metadata` annotations on the compiled
Kotlin classes still contain references to all of the functions and properties that ProGuard has deleted. Therefore
we now use the `JarFilter` to delete these references, as otherwise the Kotlin compiler will pretend that the
deleted functions and properties are still present.
* Finally, we use ProGuard again to validate our JAR against the deterministic `rt.jar`:

```groovy
task checkDeterminism(type: ProGuardTask, dependsOn: jdkTask) {
    injars metafix

    libraryjars deterministic_rt_jar

    configurations.deterministicLibraries.forEach {
        libraryjars it, filter: '!META-INF/versions/**'
    }

    keepattributes '*'
    dontpreverify
    dontobfuscate
    dontoptimize
    verbose

    keep 'class *'
}

```

[build.gradle](https://github.com/corda/corda/blob/release/os/4.1/core-deterministic/build.gradle)

This step will fail if ProGuard spots any Java API references that still cannot be satisfied by the deterministic
`rt.jar`, and hence it will break the build.



## Configuring IntelliJ with a Deterministic SDK

We would like to configure IntelliJ so that it will highlight uses of non-deterministic Java APIs as not found.
Or, more specifically, we would like IntelliJ to use the `deterministic-rt.jar` as a “Module SDK” for deterministic
modules rather than the `rt.jar` from the default project SDK, to make IntelliJ consistent with Gradle.

This is possible, but slightly tricky to configure because IntelliJ will not recognise an SDK containing only the
`deterministic-rt.jar` as being valid. It also requires that IntelliJ delegate all build tasks to Gradle, and that
Gradle be configured to use the Project’s SDK.

Gradle creates a suitable JDK image in the project’s `jdk8u-deterministic/jdk` directory, and you can
configure IntelliJ to use this location for this SDK. However, you should also be aware that IntelliJ SDKs
are available for *all* projects to use.To create this JDK image, execute the following:

```bash
$ gradlew jdk8u-deterministic:copyJdk
```


Now select `File/Project Structure/Platform Settings/SDKs` and add a new JDK SDK with the
`jdk8u-deterministic/jdk` directory as its home. Rename this SDK to something like “1.8 (Deterministic)”.This *should* be sufficient for IntelliJ. However, if IntelliJ realises that this SDK does not contain a
full JDK then you will need to configure the new SDK by hand:>

* Create a JDK Home directory with the following contents:>
`jre/lib/rt.jar`
where `rt.jar` here is this renamed artifact:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>net.corda</groupId>
    <artifactId>deterministic-rt</artifactId>
    <classifier>api</classifier>
</dependency>
```




* While IntelliJ is *not* running, locate the `config/options/jdk.table.xml` file in IntelliJ’s configuration
directory. Add an empty `<jdk>` section to this file:

```xml
<jdk version="2">
    <name value="1.8 (Deterministic)"/>
    <type value="JavaSDK"/>
    <version value="java version &quot;1.8.0&quot;"/>
    <homePath value=".. path to the deterministic JDK directory .."/>
    <roots>
    </roots>
</jdk>
```




* Open IntelliJ and select `File/Project Structure/Platform Settings/SDKs`. The “1.8 (Deterministic)” SDK
should now be present. Select it and then click on the `Classpath` tab. Press the “Add” / “Plus” button to
add `rt.jar` to the SDK’s classpath. Then select the `Annotations` tab and include the same JAR(s) as
the other SDKs.



* Open the root `build.gradle` file and define this property:

```gradle
buildscript {
    ext {
        ...
        deterministic_idea_sdk = '1.8 (Deterministic)'
        ...
    }
}
```





* Go to `File/Settings/Build, Execution, Deployment/Build Tools/Gradle`, and configure Gradle’s JVM to be the
project’s JVM.
* Go to `File/Settings/Build, Execution, Deployment/Build Tools/Gradle/Runner`, and select these options:>

* Delegate IDE build/run action to Gradle
* Run tests using the Gradle Test Runner



* Delete all of the `out` directories that IntelliJ has previously generated for each module.
* Go to `View/Tool Windows/Gradle` and click the `Refresh all Gradle projects` button.

These steps will enable IntelliJ’s presentation compiler to use the deterministic `rt.jar` with the following modules:



* `core-deterministic`
* `serialization-deterministic`
* `core-deterministic:testing:common`


but still build everything using Gradle with the full JDK.


## Testing the Deterministic Modules

The `core-deterministic:testing` module executes some basic JUnit tests for the `core-deterministic` and
`serialization-deterministic` JARs. These tests are compiled against the deterministic `rt.jar`, although
they are still executed using the full JDK.

The `testing` module also has two sub-modules:

`core-deterministic:testing:data`This module generates test data such as serialised transactions and elliptic curve key pairs using the full
non-deterministic `core` library and JDK. This data is all written into a single JAR which the `testing`
module adds to its classpath.`core-deterministic:testing:common`This module provides the test classes which the `testing` and `data` modules need to share. It is therefore
compiled against the deterministic API subset.

## Applying @KeepForDJVM and @DeleteForDJVM annotations

Corda developers need to understand how to annotate classes in the `core` and `serialization` modules correctly
in order to maintain the deterministic JARs.

{{< note >}}
Every Kotlin class still has its own `.class` file, even when all of those classes share the same
source file. Also, annotating the file:

```kotlin
@file:KeepForDJVM
package net.corda.core.internal
```


*does not* automatically annotate any class declared *within* this file. It merely annotates any
accompanying Kotlin `xxxKt` class.

{{< /note >}}
For more information about how `JarFilter` is processing the byte-code inside `core` and `serialization`,
use Gradle’s `--info` or `--debug` command-line options.

Classes that *must* be included in the deterministic JAR should be annotated as `@KeepForDJVM`.

```kotlin
@Target(FILE, CLASS)
@Retention(BINARY)
@CordaInternal
annotation class KeepForDJVM

```

[KeepForDJVM.kt](https://github.com/corda/corda/blob/release/os/4.1/core/src/main/kotlin/net/corda/core/KeepForDJVM.kt)


To preserve any Kotlin functions, properties or type aliases that have been declared outside of a `class`,
you should annotate the source file’s `package` declaration instead:

```kotlin
@file:JvmName("InternalUtils")
@file:KeepForDJVM
package net.corda.core.internal

infix fun Temporal.until(endExclusive: Temporal): Duration = Duration.between(this, endExclusive)
```


Elements that *must* be deleted from classes in the deterministic JAR should be annotated as `@DeleteForDJVM`.

```kotlin
@Target(
    FILE,
    CLASS,
    CONSTRUCTOR,
    FUNCTION,
    PROPERTY_GETTER,
    PROPERTY_SETTER,
    PROPERTY,
    FIELD,
    TYPEALIAS
)
@Retention(BINARY)
@CordaInternal
annotation class DeleteForDJVM

```

[DeleteForDJVM.kt](https://github.com/corda/corda/blob/release/os/4.1/core/src/main/kotlin/net/corda/core/DeleteForDJVM.kt)


You must also ensure that a deterministic class’s primary constructor does not reference any classes that are
not available in the deterministic `rt.jar`. The biggest risk here would be that `JarFilter` would delete the
primary constructor and that the class could no longer be instantiated, although `JarFilter` will print a warning
in this case. However, it is also likely that the “determinised” class would have a different serialisation
signature than its non-deterministic version and so become unserialisable on the deterministic JVM.Primary constructors that have non-deterministic default parameter values must still be annotated as
`@DeleteForDJVM` because they cannot be refactored without breaking Corda’s binary interface. The Kotlin compiler
will automatically apply this `@DeleteForDJVM` annotation - along with any others - to all of the class’s
secondary constructors too. The `JarFilter` plugin can then remove the `@DeleteForDJVM` annotation from the
primary constructor so that it can subsequently delete only the secondary constructors.The annotations that `JarFilter` will “sanitise” from primary constructors in this way are listed in the plugin’s
configuration block, e.g.

```groovy
task jarFilter(type: JarFilterTask) {
    ...
    annotations {
        ...

        forSanitise = [
            "net.corda.core.DeleteForDJVM"
        ]
    }
}
```


Be aware that package-scoped Kotlin properties are all initialised within a common `<clinit>` block inside
their host `.class` file. This means that when `JarFilter` deletes these properties, it cannot also remove
their initialisation code. For example:

```kotlin
package net.corda.core

@DeleteForDJVM
val map: MutableMap<String, String> = ConcurrentHashMap()
```


In this case, `JarFilter` would delete the `map` property but the `<clinit>` block would still create
an instance of `ConcurrentHashMap`. The solution here is to refactor the property into its own file and then
annotate the file itself as `@DeleteForDJVM` instead.Sometimes it is impossible to delete a function entirely. Or a function may have some non-deterministic code
embedded inside it that cannot be removed. For these rare cases, there is the `@StubOutForDJVM`
annotation:

```kotlin
@Target(
    CONSTRUCTOR,
    FUNCTION,
    PROPERTY_GETTER,
    PROPERTY_SETTER
)
@Retention(BINARY)
@CordaInternal
annotation class StubOutForDJVM

```

[StubOutForDJVM.kt](https://github.com/corda/corda/blob/release/os/4.1/core/src/main/kotlin/net/corda/core/StubOutForDJVM.kt)


This annotation instructs `JarFilter` to replace the function’s body with either an empty body (for functions
that return `void` or `Unit`) or one that throws `UnsupportedOperationException`. For example:

```kotlin
fun necessaryCode() {
    nonDeterministicOperations()
    otherOperations()
}

@StubOutForDJVM
private fun nonDeterministicOperations() {
    // etc
}
```
