UTXO ledger CorDapps should be split in to two parts:

* A contract CPK that contains all code defining the states and the smart contract ruling the creation, evolution, and consumption of the states. The contract CPK needs to be marked as such and can only have dependencies on other contract CPKs, so that it can be loaded into a verify sandbox.

* Workflow CPKs that contain all other code (workflows, persistence, business logic, and so on) that can depend on any other CPK, including the contract CPKs.

All of these CPKs can be compiled into one CPB that has both workflows and contracts. A UTXO ledger CPB must also include a notary client and be configured to use a notary. For more information about notaries, see the [Notaries section](../notaries/overview.html).

## States and Contracts

### States
Currently, only contract [states](../ledger/states.html) are defined at the platform level. A contract state must implement the `ContractState` interface and provide a list of participants in the form of their public keys that will be used for signing the relevant transaction. States must be linked to a contract using the `@BelongsToContract` annotation on the state implementation class.

### Contracts
[Contracts](../ledger/smart-contracts.html) must implement the `Contract` interface, providing an implementation of the `verify` method. This method gets given a `UtxoLedgerTransaction` and has to verify that the given combination of inputs, reference states, outputs, and commands forms a valid transaction. This is were the actual contract enforcement happens.

#### Commands
To this end, the contract implementation needs to define the commands it supports by providing one or more classes implementing the `Command` interface. Commands can be added to the transaction builder and define what the transaction does.

#### Relevancy
Optionally, contracts can override the `isRelevant` method on the `Contract` interface. This method is given each produced state in a transaction and a set of keys owned by the current virtual node.
The default implementation returns `true` (and thus marks the state as relevant), if any of the keys of the current node is among the participants of the state. However, for specific contracts, the relevancy definitions might be different. For example, if the state has an owner, it might only be relevant to the owning node by checking that the owning key is among the keys of the current virtual node.

## Interacting with the ledger

The main API to interact with the UTXO ledger is the `UtxoLedgerService`. This is a `@CordaInjectable` service that flows must request for injection by declaring an appropriately annotated member variable:

```kotlin
@CordaInjectable
lateinit var ledgerService: UtxoLedgerService
```

### TransactionBuilder
The Ledger service gives access to the `UtxoTransactionBuilder` that can be used to build a transaction by passing in inputs, outputs, reference states etc. This is very similar to Corda 4 but one difference is that all transactions need a time window with an end date and need a notary. In Corda 5 every UTXO transaction needs to be notarized, even if there are no inputs.

### Finding Transactions and States
The ledger service has methods to find states (unconsumed, relevant states of a specific type). In Corda 5.0 Beta, no further specialised queries are possible, so you must load the state of the required type and filter in the flow code. Custom queries will be available in a future release.
It is also possible to load transactions by ID.

### Finality
To finalize a transaction (verify, store, distribute to participants, collect signatures, notarize, distribute signatures), you must call the finalize function on the ledger service. On the counterparty (initiated flow), you need a matching call to `receiveFinality`. These calls will start subflows under the hood that deal with the messaging and finality.

{{< note >}}
In Beta 1, it is strongly recommended that you wrap the call to `finalize`/`receiveFinality` in a `try...catch` block. In the case of an exception, you should log and suppress the exception and jump to the end of the flow to stop any further processing.
The reason for this is that a verification or notarization failure will throw an exception and letting an exception escape out of an initializing or initialized flow will unravel the flow session. This may result in error messages not handled correctly and the error payload send by the finality responder might get lost.
