This section describes how to get started developing CorDapps using the [CorDapp Standard Development Environment (CSDE)](getting-started/get-started.md). It describes the modules of the [Corda API](api/corda-api.md) and links to the API [Javadocs](../../../../api-ref/corda/5.0-beta/java/index.html). It details the concepts behind [the ledger](ledger/ledger.md) and [notaries](notaries/overview.md). It also contains tutorials that demonstrate how to [build](development-tutorials/build-basic-cordapp/basic-cordapp-intro.md) and [package](development-tutorials/cordapp-packaging.md) a CorDapp and also how to work with the [UTXO Ledger Token Selection API](development-tutorials/token-selection.md).
