## Downloading Corda CLI

To obtain the Corda CLI installer:
1. Download `platform-jars-Eagle.tar.gz` from the [R3 Customer Hub](https://r3.force.com/).
2. Extract `corda-cli-installer-5.0.0.0-Eagle.zip` from `net\corda\cli\deployment\corda-cli-installer\5.0.0.0-Eagle`.

## Installing on Linux/macOS

1. Start a shell session (bash or zsh).
2. Change directory to where you saved `corda-cli-installer-5.0.0.0-Eagle.zip`.
3. Extract the contents of the `zip` file:
   ```shell
   unzip ./corda-cli-installer-5.0.0.0-Eagle.zip -d corda-cli-installer-5.0.0.0-Eagle
   ```
4. Change directory to the directory extracted from the `zip` file:
   ```shell
   cd corda-cli-installer-5.0.0.0-Eagle
   ```
5. Run the install script:
   ```shell
   ./install.sh
   ```
   The script installs Corda CLI to `<user-home>/.corda/cli`, where `<user-home>` refers to your user home directory. For example, on macOS, this is typically something like `/Users/charlie.smith` or on Linux, something like `/home/charlie.smith`.

6. Run the following command to verify your installation:
   ```shell
   corda-cli.sh -h
   ```
   If successful, this outputs details of the Corda CLI commands.

## Installing on Windows

1. Start a Powershell session.
2. Change directory to where you saved `corda-cli-installer-5.0.0.0-Eagle`.
3. Extract the contents of the `zip` file:
   ```shell
   Expand-Archive .\corda-cli-installer-5.0.0.0-Eagle.zip
   ```
4. Change directory to the directory extracted from the `zip` file:
   ```shell
   cd corda-cli-installer-5.0.0.0-Eagle
   ```
5. Run the install script:
   ```shell
   .\install.ps1
   ```
   The script installs Corda CLI to `<user-home>/.corda/cli`, where `<user-home>` refers to your user home directory. On Windows, this is typically something like `C:\Users\Charlie.Smith`.

   {{< note >}}
   If your PowerShell execution policy does not allow you to run this script, copy the contents to your own PowerShell script and execute that instead.

6. Run the following command to verify your installation:
  ```shell
  corda-cli.cmd -h
  ```
  If successful, this outputs details of the Corda CLI commands.
