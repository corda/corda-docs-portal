  How to locate your node's OpenAPI specification.

Use this guide to locate your node's OpenAPI specification.

As part of the Corda 5 Developer Preview, a dynamic [OpenAPI specification](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/)
(formerly known as the Swagger specification) is generated which details your node's RPC functionality, which is exposed
via a secure HTTP API. It describes:
* Endpoints, including operations and operation parameters (input and output).
* Authentication methods.

{{< note >}}

You need to [enable HTTP-RPC](../../../../../../en/platform/corda/5.0-dev-preview-1/nodes/operating/configure-nodeconf.md) before you can use the OpenAPI specification.

{{< /note >}}

Your node's OpenAPI JSON is available on a URL. If your node's HTTP-RPC address is  `mynode:8888`, you would find it on `http[s]://mynode:8888/api/v1/swagger.json`.

Here is an excerpt of a node's OpenAPI JSON:
