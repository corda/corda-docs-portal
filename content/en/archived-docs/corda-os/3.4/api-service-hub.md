# API: ServiceHub

Within `FlowLogic.call`, the flow developer has access to the node’s `ServiceHub`, which provides access to the
various services the node provides. The services offered by the `ServiceHub` are split into the following categories:


* `ServiceHub.networkMapCache`
    * Provides information on other nodes on the network (e.g. notaries…)


* `ServiceHub.identityService`
    * Allows you to resolve anonymous identities to well-known identities if you have the required certificates


* `ServiceHub.attachments`
    * Gives you access to the node’s attachments


* `ServiceHub.validatedTransactions`
    * Gives you access to the transactions stored in the node


* `ServiceHub.vaultService`
    * Stores the node’s current and historic states


* `ServiceHub.keyManagementService`
    * Manages signing transactions and generating fresh public keys


* `ServiceHub.myInfo`
    * Other information about the node


* `ServiceHub.clock`
    * Provides access to the node’s internal time and date



Additional, `ServiceHub` exposes the following properties:


* `ServiceHub.loadState` and `ServiceHub.toStateAndRef` to resolve a `StateRef` into a `TransactionState` or
a `StateAndRef`
* `ServiceHub.signInitialTransaction` to sign a `TransactionBuilder` and convert it into a `SignedTransaction`
* `ServiceHub.createSignature` and `ServiceHub.addSignature` to create and add signatures to a `SignedTransaction`
