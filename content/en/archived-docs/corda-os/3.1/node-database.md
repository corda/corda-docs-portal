# Node database

Currently, nodes store their data in an H2 database. In the future, we plan to support a wide range of databases.

You can connect directly to a running node’s database to see its stored states, transactions and attachments as
follows:


* Download the [h2 platform-independent zip](http://www.h2database.com/html/download.html), unzip the zip, and
navigate in a terminal window to the unzipped folder
* Change directories to the bin folder:`cd h2/bin`
* Run the following command to open the h2 web console in a web browser tab:
    * Unix: `sh h2.sh`
    * Windows: `h2.bat`


* Find the node’s JDBC connection string. Each node outputs its connection string in the terminal
window as it starts up. In a terminal window where a node is running, look for the following string:`Database connection URL is              : jdbc:h2:tcp://10.18.0.150:56736/node`
* Paste this string into the JDBC URL field and click `Connect`, using the default username and password.

You will be presented with a web interface that shows the contents of your node’s storage and vault, and provides an
interface for you to query them using SQL.
