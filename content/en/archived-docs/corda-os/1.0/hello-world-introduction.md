# Introduction

By this point, [your dev environment should be set up](getting-set-up.md), you’ve run
[your first CorDapp](tutorial-cordapp.md), and you’re familiar with Corda’s [key concepts](key-concepts.md). What
comes next?

If you’re a developer, the next step is to write your own CorDapp. Each CorDapp takes the form of a plugin that is
installed on one or more Corda nodes, and gives them the ability to conduct some new process - anything from
issuing a debt instrument to making a restaurant booking.


## Our use-case

Our CorDapp will seek to model IOUs on ledger. An IOU – short for “I Owe yoU” – records the fact that one person owes
another a given amount of money. We can imagine that this is potentially sensitive information that we’d only want to
communicate on a need-to-know basis. This is one of the areas where Corda excels - allowing a small set of parties to
agree on a fact without needing to share this fact with everyone else on the network, as you do with most other
blockchain platforms.

To serve any useful function, a CorDapp needs three core elements:


* **One or more states** – the shared facts that will be agreed upon and stored on the ledger
* **One or more contracts** – the rules governing how these states can evolve over time
* **One or more flows** – the step-by-step process for carrying out a ledger update

Our IOU CorDapp is no exception. It will have the following elements:


### State

The states will be IOUStates, with each instance representing a single IOU. We can visualize an IOUState as follows:


![tutorial state](/en/images/tutorial-state.png "tutorial state")


### Contract

Our contract will be the IOUContract, imposing rules on the evolution of IOUs over time:



* Only the creation of new IOUs will be allowed
* Transferring existing IOUs or paying off an IOU with cash will not be allowed


However, we can easily extend our CorDapp to handle additional use-cases later on.


### Flow

Our flow will be the IOUFlow. It will allow a node to orchestrate the creation of a new IOU on the ledger, via the
following steps:


![simple tutorial flow](resources/simple-tutorial-flow.png "simple tutorial flow")

In traditional distributed ledger systems, where all data is broadcast to every network participant, you don’t even
think about this step – you simply package up your ledger update and send it out into the world. But in Corda, where
privacy is a core focus, flows are used to carefully control who sees what during the process of agreeing a
ledger update.


## Progress so far

We’ve sketched out a simple CorDapp that will allow nodes to confidentially agree the creation of new IOUs.

Next, we’ll be taking a look at the template project we’ll be using as a base for our work.
