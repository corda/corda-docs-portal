# Running our CorDapp

Now that we’ve written a CorDapp, it’s time to test it by running it on some real Corda nodes.


## Clean up

Before running our node, delete the `client/TemplateClient.java` (for Java) or `client/TemplateClient.kt` (for
Kotlin) file. We won’t be using it, and it will cause build errors unless we remove it.


## Deploying our CorDapp

Let’s take a look at the nodes we’re going to deploy. Open the project’s `build.gradle` file and scroll down to the
`task deployNodes` section. This section defines three nodes - the Controller, NodeA, and NodeB:

{{< tabs name="tabs-1" >}}
{{% tab name="kotlin" %}}
```kotlin
task deployNodes(type: net.corda.plugins.Cordform, dependsOn: ['jar']) {
    directory "./build/nodes"
    networkMap "O=Controller,L=London,C=GB"
    node {
        name "O=Controller,L=London,C=GB"
        advertisedServices = ["corda.notary.validating"]
        p2pPort 10002
        rpcPort 10003
        cordapps = ["net.corda:corda-finance:$corda_release_version"]
    }
    node {
        name "O=PartyA,L=London,C=GB"
        advertisedServices = []
        p2pPort 10005
        rpcPort 10006
        webPort 10007
        cordapps = ["net.corda:corda-finance:$corda_release_version"]
        rpcUsers = [[ user: "user1", "password": "test", "permissions": []]]
    }
    node {
        name "O=PartyB,L=New York,C=US"
        advertisedServices = []
        p2pPort 10008
        rpcPort 10009
        webPort 10010
        cordapps = ["net.corda:corda-finance:$corda_release_version"]
        rpcUsers = [[ user: "user1", "password": "test", "permissions": []]]
    }
}
```
{{% /tab %}}

{{< /tabs >}}

We have three standard nodes, plus a special Controller node that is running the network map service, and is also
advertising a validating notary service. Feel free to add additional node definitions here to expand the size of the
test network.

We can run this `deployNodes` task using Gradle. For each node definition, Gradle will:


* Package the project’s source files into a CorDapp jar
* Create a new node in `build/nodes` with our CorDapp already installed

We can do that now by running the following commands from the root of the project:

```python
// On Windows
gradlew clean deployNodes

// On Mac
./gradlew clean deployNodes
```


## Running the nodes

Running `deployNodes` will build the nodes under `build/nodes`. If we navigate to one of these folders, we’ll see
the three node folders. Each node folder has the following structure:


```python
.
|____corda.jar                     // The runnable node
|____corda-webserver.jar           // The node's webserver
|____dependencies
|____node.conf                     // The node's configuration file
|____plugins
  |____java/kotlin-source-0.1.jar  // Our IOU CorDapp
```



Let’s start the nodes by running the following commands from the root of the project:

```python
// On Windows
build/nodes/runnodes.bat

// On Mac
build/nodes/runnodes
```

This will start a terminal window for each node, and an additional terminal window for each node’s webserver - eight
terminal windows in all. Give each node a moment to start - you’ll know it’s ready when its terminal windows displays
the message, “Welcome to the Corda interactive shell.”.

## Interacting with the nodes

Now that our nodes are running, let’s order one of them to create an IOU by kicking off our `IOUFlow`. In a larger
app, we’d generally provide a web API sitting on top of our node. Here, for simplicity, we’ll be interacting with the
node via its built-in CRaSH shell.

Go to the terminal window displaying the CRaSH shell of PartyA. Typing `help` will display a list of the available
commands.

We want to create an IOU of 100 with PartyB. We start the `IOUFlow` by typing:

{{< tabs name="tabs-2" >}}
{{% tab name="java" %}}
```java
start IOUFlow arg0: 99, arg1: "O=PartyB,L=New York,C=US"
```
{{% /tab %}}

{{% tab name="kotlin" %}}
```kotlin
start IOUFlow iouValue: 99, otherParty: "O=PartyB,L=New York,C=US"
```
{{% /tab %}}

{{< /tabs >}}

PartyA and PartyB will automatically agree an IOU. If the flow worked, it should have led to the recording of a new IOU
in the vaults of both PartyA and PartyB.

We can check the flow has worked by using an RPC operation to check the contents of each node’s vault. Typing `run`
will display a list of the available commands. We can examine the contents of a node’s vault by running:

{{< tabs name="tabs-3" >}}
{{% tab name="java" %}}
```java
run vaultQuery contractStateType: com.template.state.IOUState
```
{{% /tab %}}

{{% tab name="kotlin" %}}
```kotlin
run vaultQuery contractStateType: com.template.IOUState
```
{{% /tab %}}

{{< /tabs >}}

The vaults of PartyA and PartyB should both display the following output:

```python
states:
- state:
    data:
      value: 99
      lender: "C=GB,L=London,O=PartyA"
      borrower: "C=US,L=New York,O=PartyB"
      participants:
      - "C=GB,L=London,O=PartyA"
      - "C=US,L=New York,O=PartyB"

## Conclusion

We have written a simple CorDapp that allows IOUs to be issued onto the ledger. Like all CorDapps, our
CorDapp is made up of three key parts:


* The `IOUState`, representing IOUs on the ledger
* The `IOUContract`, controlling the evolution of IOUs over time
* The `IOUFlow`, orchestrating the process of agreeing the creation of an IOU on-ledger

Together, these three parts completely determine how IOUs are created and evolved on the ledger.


## Next steps

There are a number of improvements we could make to this CorDapp:


* We could require signatures from the lender as well the borrower, to give both parties a say in the creation of a new
`IOUState`
* We should add unit tests, using the contract-test and flow-test frameworks
* We should change `IOUState.value` from an integer to a proper amount of a given currency
* We could add an API, to make it easier to interact with the CorDapp

We will explore some of these improvements in future tutorials. But you should now be ready to develop your own
CorDapps. There’s [a more fleshed-out version of the IOU CorDapp](https://github.com/corda/cordapp-example) with an
API and web front-end, and a set of example CorDapps in [the main Corda repo](https://github.com/corda/corda), under
`samples`. An explanation of how to run these samples [here](running-the-demos.md).

As you write CorDapps, you can learn more about the API available here.
