# Deploying a node


## Using Gradle to build nodes

Nodes are usually built using a Gradle task. The canonical Gradle file for building nodes is the one used by the
CorDapp template. Both a [Java version](https://github.com/corda/cordapp-template-java/blob/master/build.gradle) and
a [Kotlin version](https://github.com/corda/cordapp-template-kotlin/blob/master/build.gradle) are available.

Cordform is the local node deployment system for CorDapps. The nodes generated are intended for experimenting,
debugging, and testing node configurations, but not for production deployment.

Here is an example Gradle task called `deployNodes` that uses the Cordform plugin to deploy three nodes, plus a
notary/network map node:

```groovy
task deployNodes(type: net.corda.plugins.Cordform, dependsOn: ['jar']) {
    directory "./build/nodes"
    networkMap "O=Controller,OU=corda,L=London,C=UK"
    node {
        name "O=Controller,OU=corda,L=London,C=UK"
        advertisedServices = ["corda.notary.validating"]
        p2pPort 10002
        rpcPort 10003
        webPort 10004
        cordapps = []
    }
    node {
        name "CN=NodeA,O=NodeA,L=London,C=UK"
        advertisedServices = []
        p2pPort 10005
        rpcPort 10006
        webPort 10007
        cordapps = []
        rpcUsers = [[ user: "user1", "password": "test", "permissions": []]]
    }
    node {
        name "CN=NodeB,O=NodeB,L=New York,C=US"
        advertisedServices = []
        p2pPort 10008
        rpcPort 10009
        webPort 10010
        cordapps = []
        rpcUsers = [[ user: "user1", "password": "test", "permissions": []]]
    }
    node {
        name "CN=NodeC,O=NodeC,L=Paris,C=FR"
        advertisedServices = []
        p2pPort 10011
        rpcPort 10012
        webPort 10013
        cordapps = []
        rpcUsers = [[ user: "user1", "password": "test", "permissions": []]]
    }
}
```

You can extend `deployNodes` to generate any number of nodes you like. The only requirement is that you must specify
one node as running the network map service, by putting their name in the `networkMap` field. In our example, the
`Controller` is set as the network map service.


{{< warning >}}
When adding nodes, make sure that there are no port clashes!

{{< /warning >}}


If your CorDapp is written in Java, you should also add the following Gradle snippet so that you can pass named arguments to your flows via the Corda shell:

```groovy
tasks.withType(JavaCompile) {
    options.compilerArgs << "-parameters"
}
```

Any CorDapps defined in the project’s source folders are also automatically registered with all the nodes defined in
`deployNodes`, even if the CorDapps are not listed in each node’s `cordapps` entry.


## Deploying your nodes

You deploy a set of nodes by running your `build.gradle` file’s Cordform task. For example, if we were using the
standard `deployNodes` task defined above, we’d create our nodes by running the following commands in a terminal
window from the root of the project:


* Unix/Mac OSX: `./gradlew deployNodes`
* Windows: `gradlew.bat deployNodes`

After the build process has finished, you will find the newly-built nodes under `kotlin-source/build/nodes`. There
will be one folder generated for each node you built, plus a `runnodes` shell script (or batch file on Windows) to
run all the nodes at once. Each node in the `nodes` folder has the following structure:

```none
. nodeName
├── corda.jar       // The Corda runtime
├── node.conf       // The node's configuration
└── plugins         // Any installed CorDapps
```

{{< note >}}
Outside of development environments, do not store your node directories in the build folder.

If you make any changes to your `deployNodes` task, you will need to re-run the task to see the changes take effect.
