# Building against Master

When developing a CorDapp, it is advisable to use the most recent Corda Milestone release, which has been extensively
tested. However, if you need to use a very recent feature of the codebase, you may need to work against the unstable
Master branch.

To work against the Master branch, proceed as follows:


* Open a terminal window in the folder where you cloned the Corda repository
(available [here](https://github.com/corda/corda))
* Use the following command to check out the latest master branch:> 
`git fetch; git checkout master`

* Publish Corda to your local Maven repository using the following commands:
    * Unix/Mac OSX: `./gradlew install`
    * Windows: `gradlew.bat install`

By default, the Maven local repository is found at:
    * `~/.m2/repository` on Unix/Mac OS X
    * `%HOMEPATH%\.m2` on Windows

This step is not necessary when using a Milestone releases, as the Milestone releases are published online


{{< warning >}}
If you do modify your local Corda repository after having published it to Maven local, then you must
re-publish it to Maven local for the local installation to reflect the changes you have made.

{{< warning >}}
As the Corda repository evolves on a daily basis, two clones of the Master branch at different points in
time may differ. If you are using a Master release and need help debugging an error, then please let us know the
**commit** you are working from. This will help us ascertain the issue.
