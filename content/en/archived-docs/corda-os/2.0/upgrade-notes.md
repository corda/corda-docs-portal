# Upgrade notes

These notes provide helpful instructions to upgrade your Corda Applications (CorDapps) from previous versions, starting
from our first public Beta ([Milestone 12](changelog.html#milestone-12)), to [V1.0](changelog.html#changelog-v1)


## General

Always remember to update the version identifiers in your project gradle file:

```shell
ext.corda_release_version = '1.0.0'
ext.corda_gradle_plugins_version = '1.0.0'
```

It may be necessary to update the version of major dependencies:

```shell
ext.kotlin_version = '1.1.4'
ext.quasar_version = '0.7.9'
```

Please consult the relevant release notes of the release in question. If not specified, you may assume the
versions you are currently using are still in force.

We also strongly recommend cross referencing with the [Changelog](changelog.md) to confirm changes.


## [Milestone 14](changelog.html#milestone-14)


### Build


* MockNetwork has moved.A new test driver module dependency needs to be including in your project: *corda-node-driver*. To continue using the
mock network for testing, add the following entry to your gradle build file:

```shell
testCompile "net.corda:corda-node-driver:$corda_release_version"
```

{{< note >}}
you may only need *testCompile “net.corda:corda-test-utils:$corda_release_version”* if not using the Driver DSL.

{{< /note >}}

### Configuration


* `CordaPluginRegistry` has been removed.
The one remaining configuration item `customizeSerialisation`, which defined a optional whitelist of types for use in
object serialization, has been replaced with the `SerializationWhitelist` interface which should be implemented to
define a list of equivalent whitelisted classes.
You will need to rename your services resource file to the new class name:
‘resources/META-INF/services/net.corda.core.node.CordaPluginRegistry’ becomes ‘resources/META-INF/services/net.corda.core.serialization.SerializationWhitelist’
An associated property on `MockNode` was renamed from `testPluginRegistries` to `testSerializationWhitelists`.
In general, the `@CordaSerializable` annotation is the preferred method for whitelisting as described in [Object serialization](serialization.md)


### Missing imports

Use the automatic imports feature of IntelliJ to intelligently resolve the new imports.


* Missing imports for contract types.CommercialPaper and Cash are now contained within the *finance* module, as are associated helpers functions.
For example:>
`import net.corda.contracts.ICommercialPaperState` becomes `import net.corda.finance.contracts.ICommercialPaperState``import net.corda.contracts.asset.sumCashBy` becomes `import net.corda.finance.utils.sumCashBy``import net.corda.core.contracts.DOLLARS` becomes `import net.corda.finance.DOLLARS``import net.corda.core.contracts.issued by` becomes `import net.corda.finance.issued by``import net.corda.contracts.asset.Cash` becomes `import net.corda.finance.contracts.asset.Cash`

* Missing imports for utility functions.Many common types and helper methods have been consolidated into *net.corda.core.utilities* package.
For example:>
`import net.corda.core.crypto.commonName` becomes `import net.corda.core.utilities.commonName``import net.corda.core.crypto.toBase58String` becomes `import net.corda.core.utilities.toBase58String``import net.corda.core.getOrThrow` becomes `import net.corda.core.utilities.getOrThrow`

* Missing flow imports.In general all reusable library flows are contained within the **core** API *net.corda.core.flows* package.
Financial domain library flows are contained within the **finance** module *net.corda.finance.flows* package.
Other flows that have moved include:`import net.corda.core.flows.ResolveTransactionsFlow` becomes `import net.corda.core.internal.ResolveTransactionsFlow`


### Core data structures


* Missing Contract override.The contract interace attribute `legalContractReference` has been removed, and replaced by
the optional annotation `@LegalProseReference(uri = "<URI>")`
* Unresolved reference.Calls to `AuthenticatedObject` are replaced by `CommandWithParties`
* Overrides nothing: `isRelevant` in `LinearState`.Removed the concept of relevancy from `LinearState`. A `ContractState`’s relevance to the vault is now resolved
internally; the vault will process any transaction from a flow which is not derived from transaction resolution verification.
The notion of relevancy is subject to further improvements to enable a developer to control what state the vault thinks
are relevant.
* Calls to `txBuilder.toLedgerTransaction()` now requires a serviceHub parameter.Used by the new Contract Constraints functionality to validate and resolve attachments.


### Flow framework


* Flow session deprecations`FlowLogic` communication has been upgraded to use functions on `FlowSession` as the base for communication
between nodes.
    * Calls to `send()`, `receive()` and `sendAndReceive()` on FlowLogic should be replaced with calls
to the function of the same name on `FlowSession`. Note that the replacement functions do not take in a destination
parameter, as this is defined in the session.
    * Initiated flows now take in a `FlowSession` instead of `Party` in their constructor. If you need to access the
counterparty identity, it is in the `counterparty` property of the flow session.

See `FlowSession` for step by step instructions on porting existing flows to use the new mechanism.
* `FinalityFlow` now returns a single `SignedTransaction`, instead of a `List<SignedTransaction>`
* `TransactionKeyFlow` renamed to `SwapIdentitiesFlow`Note that `SwapIdentitiesFlow` must be imported from the *confidential-identities** package ‘’net.corda.confidential’’


### Node services (ServiceHub)


* VaultQueryService: unresolved reference to *vaultQueryService*.Replace all references to `<services>.vaultQueryService` with `<services>.vaultService`.
Previously there were two vault APIs. Now there is a single unified API with the same functions: `VaultService`.
* `serviceHub.myInfo.legalIdentity` no longer exists; use the `ourIdentity` property of the flow instead.`FlowLogic.ourIdentity` has been introduced as a shortcut for retrieving our identity in a flow
* `getAnyNotary` is gone - use `serviceHub.networkMapCache.notaryIdentities[0]` instead>
Note: ongoing work to support multiple notary identities is still in progress.

* `ServiceHub.networkMapUpdates` is replaced by `ServiceHub.networkMapFeed`
* `ServiceHub.partyFromX500Name` is replaced by `ServiceHub.wellKnownPartyFromX500Name`
Note: A “well known” party is one that isn’t anonymous and this change was motivated by the confidential identities work.


### RPC Client


* Missing API methods on *CordaRPCOps* interface.
    * Calls to `verifiedTransactionsFeed()` and `verifiedTransactions()` have been replaced with:
`internalVerifiedTransactionsSnapshot()` and `internalVerifiedTransactionsFeed()` respectivelyThis is in preparation for the planned integration of Intel SGX™, which will encrypt the transactions feed.
Apps that use this API will not work on encrypted ledgers: you should probably be using the vault query API instead.
    * Accessing the *networkMapCache* via `services.nodeInfo().legalIdentities` returns a list of identities.
The first element in the list is the Party object referring to a node’s single identity.This is in preparation for allowing a node to host multiple separate identities in future.




### Testing

Please note that *Clauses* have been removed completely as of V1.0.
We will be revisiting this capability in a future release.


* CorDapps must be explicitly registered in `MockNetwork` unit tests.This is done by calling `setCordappPackages`, an extension helper function in the `net.corda.testing` package,
on the first line of your *@Before* method. This takes a variable number of *String* arguments which should be the
package names of the CorDapps containing the contract verification code you wish to load.
You should unset CorDapp packages in your *@After* method by using `unsetCordappPackages()` after *stopNodes()*.
* CorDapps must be explicitly registered in `DriverDSL` and `RPCDriverDSL` integration tests.Similarly, you must also register package names of the CorDapps containing the contract verification code you wish to load
using the `extraCordappPackagesToScan: List<String>` constructor parameter of the driver DSL.


### Finance


* *FungibleAsset* interface simplification.The `FungibleAsset` interface has been made simpler. The `Commands` grouping interface
that included the `Move`, `Issue` and `Exit` interfaces have all been removed, while the `move` function has
been renamed to `withNewOwnerAndAmount` to be consistent with the `withNewOwner` function of the `OwnableState`.The following errors may be reported:
    * override nothing (FungibleAsset): *move*
    * not a subtype of overridden FungibleAsset: *withNewOwner*
    * no longer need to override *override val contractHash: SecureHash? = null*
    * need to override *override val contract: Class<out Contract>? = null*




### Miscellaneous


* `args[0].parseNetworkHostAndPort()` becomes `NetworkHostAndPort.parse(args[0])`
* There is no longer a `NodeInfo.advertisedServices` property.The concept of advertised services has been removed from Corda. This is because it was vaguely defined and real world
apps would not typically select random, unknown counterparties from the network map based on self-declared capabilities.
We will introduce a replacement for this functionality, business networks, in a future release.For now, your should retrieve the service by legal name using `NetworkMapCache.getNodeByLegalName`.


### Gotchas


* Beware to use the correct identity when issuing cash:The 3rd parameter to `CashIssueFlow` should be the ** notary ** (not the ** node identity
{{< warning >}}**{{< /warning >}}

)


## [Milestone 13](changelog.html#milestone-13)


### Core data structures


* *TransactionBuilder* changes.Use convenience class `StateAndContract` instead of `TransactionBuilder.withItems()` for passing
around a state and its contract.
* Transaction building DSL changes:
    * now need to explicitly pass the ContractClassName into all inputs and outputs.
    * *ContractClassName* refers to the class containing the “verifier” method.


* Contract verify method signature change.`override fun verify(tx: TransactionForContract)` becomes `override fun verify(tx: LedgerTransaction)`
* No longer need to override Contract `contract()` function.


### Node services (ServiceHub)


* ServiceHub API method changes.`services.networkMapUpdates().justSnapshot` becomes `services.networkMapSnapshot()`


### Configuration


* No longer need to define `CordaPluginRegistry` and configure `requiredSchemas`Custom contract schemas are automatically detected at startup time by class path scanning.
For testing purposes, use the `SchemaService` method to register new custom schemas:
eg. `services.schemaService.registerCustomSchemas(setOf(YoSchemaV1))`


### Identity


* Party names are now `CordaX500Name`, not `X500Name``CordaX500Name` specifies a predefined set of mandatory (organisation, locality, country)
and optional fields (commonName, organisationUnit, state) with validation checking.
Use new builder CordaX500Name.build(X500Name(target)) or, preferably, explicitly define X500Name parameters using
`CordaX500Name` constructor.


### Testing


* MockNetwork Testing.Mock nodes in node tests are now of type `StartedNode<MockNode>`, rather than `MockNode`
MockNetwork now returns a BasketOf(<StartedNode<MockNode>>)
Must call internals on StartedNode to get MockNode:>
a = nodes.partyNodes[0].internals
b = nodes.partyNodes[1].internals

* Host and Port change.`parseNetworkHostAndPort()` to parse a URL on startup.eg. `val hostAndPort = args[0].parseNetworkHostAndPort()`
* The node driver parameters for starting a node have been reordered, and the node’s name needs to be given as an
`CordaX500Name`, instead of using `getX509Name`


## [Milestone 12](changelog.html#milestone-12-first-public-beta) (First Public Beta)


### Core data structures


* Transaction buildingYou no longer need to specify the type of a `TransactionBuilder` as `TransactionType.General`
`TransactionType.General.Builder(notary)` becomes `TransactionBuilder(notary)`


### Build


* Gradle dependency reference changes.Module name has changed to include *corda* in the artifacts jar name:

```shell
compile "net.corda:core:$corda_release_version" -> compile "net.corda:corda-core:$corda_release_version"
compile "net.corda:finance:$corda_release_version" -> compile "net.corda:corda-finance:$corda_release_version"
compile "net.corda:jackson:$corda_release_version" -> compile "net.corda:corda-jackson:$corda_release_version"
compile "net.corda:node:$corda_release_version" -> compile "net.corda:corda-node:$corda_release_version"
compile "net.corda:rpc:$corda_release_version" -> compile "net.corda:corda-rpc:$corda_release_version"
```


### Node services (ServiceHub)


* ServiceHub API changes.`services.networkMapUpdates()` becomes `services.networkMapFeed()`
`services.getCashBalances()` becomes a helper method within the **finance** module contracts package: `net.corda.finance.contracts.getCashBalances`


### Finance


* Financial asset contracts (Cash, CommercialPaper, Obligations) are now a standalone CorDapp within the **finance** module.*finance* module:eg. `net.corda.finance.contracts.asset.Cash`*finance* module:`net.corda.finance.flows.CashIssueFlow``net.corda.finance.flows.CashIssueAndPaymentFlow`
`net.corda.finance.flows.CashExitFlow`
* Moved `finance` gradle project files into a `net.corda.finance` package namespace.This may require adjusting imports of Cash flow references and also of `StartFlow` permission in `gradle.build` files.
Associated flows (*Cash*Flow*, *TwoPartyTradeFlow*, *TwoPartyDealFlow*) must now be imported from this package.
