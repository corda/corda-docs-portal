# Node configuration


## File location

The Corda all-in-one `corda.jar` file is generated by the `gradle buildCordaJAR` task and defaults to reading configuration
from a `node.conf` file in the present working directory. This behaviour can be overidden using the `--config-file`
command line option to target configuration files with different names, or different file location (relative paths are
relative to the current working directory). Also, the `--base-directory` command line option alters the Corda node
workspace location and if specified a `node.conf` configuration file is then expected in the root of the workspace.

The configuration file templates used for the `gradle deployNodes` task are to be found in the `/config/dev` folder.
Also note that there is a basic set of defaults loaded from the built in resource file `/node/src/main/resources/reference.conf`
of the `:node` gradle module. All properties in this can be overidden in the file configuration and for rarely changed
properties this defaulting allows the property to be excluded from the configuration file.


## Format

The Corda configuration file uses the HOCON format which is superset of JSON. It has several features which makes it
very useful as a configuration format. Please visit their [page](https://github.com/typesafehub/config/blob/master/HOCON.md)
for further details.


## Examples

```


## Fields

The available config fields are listed below. `baseDirectory` is available as a substitution value, containing the absolute
path to the node’s base directory.


* **myLegalName**: 
The legal identity of the node acts as a human readable alias to the node’s public key and several demos use
this to lookup the NodeInfo.


* **keyStorePassword**: 
The password to unlock the KeyStore file (`<workspace>/certificates/sslkeystore.jks`) containing the
node certificate and private key.

{{< note >}}
This is the non-secret value for the development certificates automatically generated during the first node run.
Longer term these keys will be managed in secure hardware devices.

{{< /note >}}

* **trustStorePassword**: 
The password to unlock the Trust store file (`<workspace>/certificates/truststore.jks`) containing
the Corda network root certificate. This is the non-secret value for the development certificates automatically
generated during the first node run.

{{< note >}}
Longer term these keys will be managed in secure hardware devices.

{{< /note >}}

* **dataSourceProperties**: 
This section is used to configure the jdbc connection and database driver used for the nodes persistence.
Currently the defaults in `/node/src/main/resources/reference.conf` are as shown in the first example. This is currently
the only configuration that has been tested, although in the future full support for other storage layers will be validated.


* **messagingServerAddress**: 
The address of the ArtemisMQ broker instance. If not provided the node will run one locally.


* **p2pAddress**: 
The host and port on which the node is available for protocol operations over ArtemisMQ.

{{< note >}}
In practice the ArtemisMQ messaging services bind to all local addresses on the specified port. However,
note that the host is the included as the advertised entry in the NetworkMapService. As a result the value listed
here must be externally accessible when running nodes across a cluster of machines. If the provided host is unreachable,
the node will try to auto-discover its public one.

{{< /note >}}

* **rpcAddress**: 
The address of the RPC system on which RPC requests can be made to the node. If not provided then the node will run without RPC.


* **webAddress**: 
The host and port on which the webserver will listen if it is started. This is not used by the node itself.

{{< note >}}
If HTTPS is enabled then the browser security checks will require that the accessing url host name is one
of either the machine name, fully qualified machine name, or server IP address to line up with the Subject Alternative
Names contained within the development certificates. This is addition to requiring the `/config/dev/corda_dev_ca.cer`
root certificate be installed as a Trusted CA.

{{< /note >}}
{{< note >}}
The driver will not automatically create a webserver instance, but the Cordformation will. If this field
is present the web server will start.

{{< /note >}}

* **extraAdvertisedServiceIds**: 
A list of ServiceType id strings to be advertised to the NetworkMapService and thus be available
when other nodes query the NetworkMapCache for supporting nodes. This can also include plugin services loaded from .jar
files in the plugins folder. Optionally, a custom advertised service name can be provided by appending it to the service
type id: `"corda.notary.validating|Notary A"`


* **notaryNodeAddress**: 
The host and port to which to bind the embedded Raft server. Required only when running a distributed
notary service. A group of Corda nodes can run a distributed notary service by each running an embedded Raft server and
joining them to the same cluster to replicate the committed state log. Note that the Raft cluster uses a separate transport
layer for communication that does not integrate with ArtemisMQ messaging services.


* **notaryClusterAddresses**: 
List of Raft cluster member addresses used to join the cluster. At least one of the specified
members must be active and be able to communicate with the cluster leader for joining. If empty, a new cluster will be
bootstrapped. Required only when running a distributed notary service.


* **networkMapService**: 
If *null*, or missing the node is declaring itself as the NetworkMapService host. Otherwise this is
a config object with the details of the network map service:



* **address**: 
Host and port string of the ArtemisMQ broker hosting the network map node


* **legalName**: 
Legal name of the node. This is required as part of the TLS host verification process. The node will
reject the connection to the network map service if it provides a TLS common name which doesn’t match with this value.





* **minimumPlatformVersion**: 
Used by the node if it’s running the network map service to enforce a minimum version requirement
on registrations - any node on a Platform Version lower than this value will have their registration rejected.
Defaults to 1 if absent.


* **useHTTPS**: 
If false the node’s web server will be plain HTTP. If true the node will use the same certificate and private
key from the `<workspace>/certificates/sslkeystore.jks` file as the ArtemisMQ port for HTTPS. If HTTPS is enabled
then unencrypted HTTP traffic to the node’s **webAddress** port is not supported.


* **rpcUsers**: 
A list of users who are authorised to access the RPC system. Each user in the list is a config object with the
following fields:



* **username**: 
Username consisting only of word characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9 and _)


* **password**: 
The password


* **permissions**: 
A list of permission strings which RPC methods can use to control access




If this field is absent or an empty list then RPC is effectively locked down. Alternatively, if it contains the string
`ALL` then the user is permitted to use *any* RPC method. This value is intended for administrator users and for developers.


* **devMode**: 
This flag sets the node to run in development mode. On startup, if the keystore `<workspace>/certificates/sslkeystore.jks`
does not exist, a developer keystore will be used if `devMode` is true. The node will exit if `devMode` is false
and the keystore does not exist. `devMode` also turns on background checking of flow checkpoints to shake out any
bugs in the checkpointing process.


* **detectPublicIp**: 
This flag toggles the auto IP detection behaviour, it is enabled by default. On startup the node will
attempt to discover its externally visible IP address first by looking for any public addresses on its network
interfaces, and then by sending an IP discovery request to the network map service. Set to `false` to disable.


* **certificateSigningService**: 
Certificate Signing Server address. It is used by the certificate signing request utility to
obtain SSL certificate. (See [Network permissioning (Doorman)](permissioning.md) for more information.)
