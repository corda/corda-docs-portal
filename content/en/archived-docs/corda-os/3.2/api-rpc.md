# API: RPC operations

The node’s owner interacts with the node solely via remote procedure calls (RPC). The node’s owner does not have
access to the node’s `ServiceHub`.

The key RPC operations exposed by the node are:


* `CordaRPCOps.vaultQueryBy`
    * Extract states from the node’s vault based on a query criteria


* `CordaRPCOps.vaultTrackBy`
    * As above, but also returns an observable of future states matching the query


* `CordaRPCOps.networkMapFeed`
    * A list of network nodes, and an observable of changes to the network map


* `CordaRPCOps.registeredFlows`
    * See a list of registered flows on the node


* `CordaRPCOps.startFlowDynamic`
    * Start one of the node’s registered flows


* `CordaRPCOps.startTrackedFlowDynamic`
    * As above, but also returns a progress handle for the flow


* `CordaRPCOps.nodeInfo`
    * Returns information about the node


* `CordaRPCOps.currentNodeTime`
    * Returns the current time according to the node’s clock


* `CordaRPCOps.partyFromKey/CordaRPCOps.wellKnownPartyFromX500Name`
    * Retrieves a party on the network based on a public key or X500 name


* `CordaRPCOps.uploadAttachment`/`CordaRPCOps.openAttachment`/`CordaRPCOps.attachmentExists`
    * Uploads, opens and checks for the existence of attachments
