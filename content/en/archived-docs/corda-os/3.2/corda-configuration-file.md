# Node configuration


## File location

The Corda all-in-one `corda.jar` file is generated by the `gradle buildCordaJAR` task and defaults to reading configuration
from a `node.conf` file in the present working directory. This behaviour can be overidden using the `--config-file`
command line option to target configuration files with different names, or different file location (relative paths are
relative to the current working directory). Also, the `--base-directory` command line option alters the Corda node
workspace location and if specified a `node.conf` configuration file is then expected in the root of the workspace.

The configuration file templates used for the `gradle deployNodes` task are to be found in the `/config/dev` folder.
Also note that there is a basic set of defaults loaded from the built in resource file `/node/src/main/resources/reference.conf`
of the `:node` gradle module. All properties in this can be overidden in the file configuration and for rarely changed
properties this defaulting allows the property to be excluded from the configuration file.


## Format

The Corda configuration file uses the HOCON format which is superset of JSON. It has several features which makes it
very useful as a configuration format. Please visit their [page](https://github.com/typesafehub/config/blob/master/HOCON.md)
for further details.


## Examples

General node configuration file for hosting the IRSDemo services.

```javascript
myLegalName : "O=Bank A,L=London,C=GB"
keyStorePassword : "cordacadevpass"
trustStorePassword : "trustpass"
dataSourceProperties : {
    dataSourceClassName : org.h2.jdbcx.JdbcDataSource
    "dataSource.url" : "jdbc:h2:file:"${baseDirectory}"/persistence"
    "dataSource.user" : sa
    "dataSource.password" : ""
}
p2pAddress : "my-corda-node:10002"
rpcSettings = {
    useSsl = false
    standAloneBroker = false
    address : "my-corda-node:10003"
    adminAddress : "my-corda-node:10004"
}
webAddress : "localhost:10004"
rpcUsers : [
    { username=user1, password=letmein, permissions=[ StartFlow.net.corda.protocols.CashProtocol ] }
]
devMode : true

```

[example-node.conf](https://github.com/corda/corda/blob/release/os/3.2/docs/source/example-code/src/main/resources/example-node.conf)

```kotlin
myLegalName : "O=Notary Service,OU=corda,L=London,C=GB"
keyStorePassword : "cordacadevpass"
trustStorePassword : "trustpass"
p2pAddress : "localhost:12345"
rpcSettings = {
    useSsl = false
    standAloneBroker = false
    address : "my-corda-node:10003"
    adminAddress : "my-corda-node:10004"
}
webAddress : "localhost:12347"
notary : {
    validating : false
}
devMode : true
compatibilityZoneURL : "https://cz.corda.net"
```


## Fields

The available config fields are listed below. `baseDirectory` is available as a substitution value, containing the absolute
path to the node’s base directory.


* **myLegalName**: 
The legal identity of the node acts as a human readable alias to the node’s public key and several demos use
this to lookup the NodeInfo.


* **keyStorePassword**: 
The password to unlock the KeyStore file (`<workspace>/certificates/sslkeystore.jks`) containing the
node certificate and private key.

{{< note >}}
This is the non-secret value for the development certificates automatically generated during the first node run.
Longer term these keys will be managed in secure hardware devices.

{{< /note >}}

* **trustStorePassword**: 
The password to unlock the Trust store file (`<workspace>/certificates/truststore.jks`) containing
the Corda network root certificate. This is the non-secret value for the development certificates automatically
generated during the first node run.

{{< note >}}
Longer term these keys will be managed in secure hardware devices.

{{< /note >}}

* **database**: 
Database configuration:


* **serverNameTablePrefix**: 
Prefix string to apply to all the database tables. The default is no prefix.


* **transactionIsolationLevel**: 
Transaction isolation level as defined by the `TRANSACTION_` constants in
`java.sql.Connection`, but without the “
{{< warning >}}TRANSACTION_{{< /warning >}}

” prefix. Defaults to REPEATABLE_READ.


* **exportHibernateJMXStatistics**: 
Whether to export Hibernate JMX statistics (caution: expensive run-time overhead)




* **dataSourceProperties**: 
This section is used to configure the jdbc connection and database driver used for the nodes persistence.
Currently the defaults in `/node/src/main/resources/reference.conf` are as shown in the first example. This is currently
the only configuration that has been tested, although in the future full support for other storage layers will be validated.


* **messagingServerAddress**: 
The address of the ArtemisMQ broker instance. If not provided the node will run one locally.


* **p2pAddress**: 
The host and port on which the node is available for protocol operations over ArtemisMQ.

{{< note >}}
In practice the ArtemisMQ messaging services bind to all local addresses on the specified port. However,
note that the host is the included as the advertised entry in the network map. As a result the value listed
here must be externally accessible when running nodes across a cluster of machines. If the provided host is unreachable,
the node will try to auto-discover its public one.

{{< /note >}}

* **rpcAddress**: 
The address of the RPC system on which RPC requests can be made to the node. If not provided then the node will run without RPC. This is now deprecated in favour of the `rpcSettings` block.


* **rpcSettings**: 
Options for the RPC server.


* **useSsl**: 
(optional) boolean, indicates whether the node should require clients to use SSL for RPC connections, defaulted to `false`.


* **standAloneBroker**: 
(optional) boolean, indicates whether the node will connect to a standalone broker for RPC, defaulted to `false`.


* **address**: 
(optional) host and port for the RPC server binding, if any.


* **adminAddress**: 
(optional) host and port for the RPC admin binding (only required when `useSsl` is `false`, because the node connects to Artemis using SSL to ensure admin privileges are not accessible outside the node).


* **ssl**: 
(optional) SSL settings for the RPC server.


* **keyStorePassword**: 
password for the key store.


* **trustStorePassword**: 
password for the trust store.


* **certificatesDirectory**: 
directory in which the stores will be searched, unless absolute paths are provided.


* **sslKeystore**: 
absolute path to the ssl key store, defaulted to `certificatesDirectory / "sslkeystore.jks"`.


* **trustStoreFile**: 
absolute path to the trust store, defaulted to `certificatesDirectory / "truststore.jks"`.






* **security**: 
Contains various nested fields controlling user authentication/authorization, in particular for RPC accesses. See
[Client RPC](clientrpc.md) for details.


* **webAddress**: 
The host and port on which the webserver will listen if it is started. This is not used by the node itself.

{{< note >}}
If HTTPS is enabled then the browser security checks will require that the accessing url host name is one
of either the machine name, fully qualified machine name, or server IP address to line up with the Subject Alternative
Names contained within the development certificates. This is addition to requiring the `/config/dev/corda_dev_ca.cer`
root certificate be installed as a Trusted CA.

{{< /note >}}
{{< note >}}
The driver will not automatically create a webserver instance, but the Cordformation will. If this field
is present the web server will start.

{{< /note >}}

* **notary**: 
Optional configuration object which if present configures the node to run as a notary. If part of a Raft or BFT SMaRt
cluster then specify `raft` or `bftSMaRt` respectively as described below. If a single node notary then omit both.


* **validating**: 
Boolean to determine whether the notary is a validating or non-validating one.


* **raft**: 
If part of a distributed Raft cluster specify this config object, with the following settings:


* **nodeAddress**: 
The host and port to which to bind the embedded Raft server. Note that the Raft cluster uses a
separate transport layer for communication that does not integrate with ArtemisMQ messaging services.


* **clusterAddresses**: 
Must list the addresses of all the members in the cluster. At least one of the members must
be active and be able to communicate with the cluster leader for the node to join the cluster. If empty, a
new cluster will be bootstrapped.




* **bftSMaRt**: 
If part of a distributed BFT-SMaRt cluster specify this config object, with the following settings:


* **replicaId**: 
The zero-based index of the current replica. All replicas must specify a unique replica id.


* **clusterAddresses**: 
Must list the addresses of all the members in the cluster. At least one of the members must
be active and be able to communicate with the cluster leader for the node to join the cluster. If empty, a
new cluster will be bootstrapped.




* **custom**: 
If *true*, will load and install a notary service from a CorDapp. See [Writing a custom notary service (experimental)](tutorial-custom-notary.md).



Only one of `raft`, `bftSMaRt` or `custom` configuration values may be specified.


* **rpcUsers**: 
A list of users who are authorised to access the RPC system. Each user in the list is a config object with the
following fields:


* **username**: 
Username consisting only of word characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9 and _)


* **password**: 
The password


* **permissions**: 
A list of permissions for starting flows via RPC. To give the user the permission to start the flow
`foo.bar.FlowClass`, add the string `StartFlow.foo.bar.FlowClass` to the list. If the list
contains the string `ALL`, the user can start any flow via RPC. This value is intended for administrator
users and for development.




* **devMode**: 
This flag sets the node to run in development mode. On startup, if the keystore `<workspace>/certificates/sslkeystore.jks`
does not exist, a developer keystore will be used if `devMode` is true. The node will exit if `devMode` is false
and the keystore does not exist. `devMode` also turns on background checking of flow checkpoints to shake out any
bugs in the checkpointing process. Also, if `devMode` is true, Hibernate will try to automatically create the schema required by Corda
or update an existing schema in the SQL database; if `devMode` is false, Hibernate will simply validate an existing schema
failing on node start if this schema is either not present or not compatible.


* **detectPublicIp**: 
This flag toggles the auto IP detection behaviour, it is enabled by default. On startup the node will
attempt to discover its externally visible IP address first by looking for any public addresses on its network
interfaces, and then by sending an IP discovery request to the network map service. Set to `false` to disable.


* **compatibilityZoneURL**: 
The root address of Corda compatibility zone network management services, it is used by the Corda node to register with the network and
obtain Corda node certificate, (See [Network permissioning](permissioning.md) for more information.) and also used by the node to obtain network map information. Cannot be
set at the same time as the `networkServices` option.


* **networkServices**: 
If the Corda compatibility zone services, both network map and registration (doorman), are not running on the same endpoint
and thus have different URLs then this option should be used in place of the `compatibilityZoneURL` setting.


* **doormanURL**: 
Root address of the network registration service.


* **networkMapURL**: 
Root address of the network map service.





{{< note >}}
Only one of `compatibilityZoneURL` or `networkServices` should be used.

{{< /note >}}

* **jvmArgs**: 
An optional list of JVM args, as strings, which replace those inherited from the command line when launching via `corda.jar`
only. e.g. `jvmArgs = [ "-Xmx220m", "-Xms220m", "-XX:+UseG1GC" ]`


* **systemProperties**: 
An optional map of additional system properties to be set when launching via `corda.jar` only.  Keys and values
of the map should be strings. e.g. `systemProperties = { visualvm.display.name = FooBar }`


* **jarDirs**: 
An optional list of file system directories containing JARs to include in the classpath when launching via `corda.jar` only.
Each should be a string.  Only the JARs in the directories are added, not the directories themselves.  This is useful
for including JDBC drivers and the like. e.g. `jarDirs = [ 'lib' ]`


* **sshd**: 
If provided, node will start internal SSH server which will provide a management shell. It uses the same credentials and permissions as RPC subsystem. It has one required parameter.


* **port**: 
The port to start SSH server on




* **exportJMXTo**: 
If set to `http`, will enable JMX metrics reporting via the Jolokia HTTP/JSON agent.
Default Jolokia access url is [http://127.0.0.1:7005/jolokia/](http://127.0.0.1:7005/jolokia/)


* **transactionCacheSizeMegaBytes**: 
Optionally specify how much memory should be used for caching of ledger transactions in memory.
Otherwise defaults to 8MB plus 5% of all heap memory above 300MB.


* **attachmentContentCacheSizeMegaBytes**: 
Optionally specify how much memory should be used to cache attachment contents in memory.
Otherwise defaults to 10MB


* **attachmentCacheBound**: 
Optionally specify how many attachments should be cached locally. Note that this includes only the key and
metadata, the content is cached separately and can be loaded lazily. Defaults to 1024.
