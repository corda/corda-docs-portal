# Configuring the ENM services to use SSL

The following components of the ENM suite can all be configured to encrypt their inter-process communication channels.


* Identity Manager (containing previously named Doorman and Revocation services)
* Network Map
* Signing Service

How to configure this is discussed in this section, whilst the flow of information between these various components
is shown in the following diagram

![enm with ssl](/en/images/enm-with-ssl.png "enm with ssl")

## Recommended Key and Cert hierarchy

For SSL to work some PKI infrastructure must be in place. We recommend generating a self signed root key that can
then be used to sign a key for each service. This way, all that needs distributing to the machines hosting the JVMs
running the ENM components is a keystore containing the trust root (the Certificate representing the root key) and a
keystore containing the keypair generated for that service.

The SSL handshake will, when one component talks to another, check that the exchanged keys have a certificate chain
that chains back to the common root.


{{< important >}}
For the avoidance of doubt, the trust root, certificates and keys used to secure communication between
ENM components are completely independent of those created/managed by this toolset for the management of
a Corda network.


{{< /important >}}

Thus the key signing hierarchy would be


* Root
* Identity Manager
* Network Map
* Revocation
* Signing Service (including CSRs, CRRs, CRLs, Network Parameters, and the Network Map)

{{< note >}}
A single self-signed key can be used. However, we consider this a less secure option that should not be used
outside of a testing environment.

{{< /note >}}

## Configuration

In general ENM components are configured with SSL via the inclusion of an `ssl` config block
#. The SSL settings themselves, locations of keystores and passwords
#. The enabling of individual communication channels to use SSL.


{{< warning >}}
If you enable SSL server side, for example on the Identity Manager, then any client that will talk to that
service must configure SSL for that communication stream.

{{< /warning >}}


SSL enablement *could* be mixed within a single ENM deployment, with only a select set of channels encrypted,
but it will almost certainly be easier to roll it out as a whole.

{{< note >}}
By client, we are referring to elements of the ENM suite talking to another that is listening for such
messaging. This does not refer to, and has no impact on, the interaction of the ENM tools and Corda nodes
acting as clients of the network.

{{< /note >}}

### SSL Certificate Configuring

All components should be configured to use SSL with the following configuration block. More details can be found in
[Identity Manager Configuration Parameters](config-identity-manager-parameters.md) and [Network Map Configuration Parameters](config-network-map-parameters.md)

```docker
ssl = {
    keyStore = {
        location = /path/to/keystore.jks
        password = <key store password>
        keyPassword = <key password>
    }
    trustStore = {
        location = /path/to/trustroot.jks
        password = <key store password>
    }
}
```

The `keyStore` contains the public and private keypair of the service signed by the root key


{{< important >}}
The root key should not be in this keystore, only the keypair and the associated certificate associated
with this ENM service.


{{< /important >}}

The `trustStore` contains the root keyâ€™s certificate. This is, in effect, common across the entire ENM deployment
as it is this that enables the various components to trust one another checking that the certificate presented
chains back to this root certificate.

However, if the key and keystore passwords are the same, then the `keyPassword` option can be omitted

```docker
ssl = {
    keyStore = {
        location = /path/to/keystore.jks
        password = <key store and key password>
    }
    trustStore = {
        location = /path/to/trustroot.jks
        password = <key store password>
    }
}
```

Finally, if the keystore contains the trustroot, then the trustStore can in turn be omitted.

```docker
ssl = {
    keyStore = {
        location = /path/to/keystore.jks
        password = <key store and key password>
    }
}
```


### Server Side Enablement

Those services that open ports for other ENM components to talk to can enable SSL by including the above settings within
their `enmListener` configuration block:

```docker
enmListener {
    port = 5050
    ssl = {
        <<< As configured above >>>
    }
}
```

This will include the `Network Map` as well as both the `Issuance` and `Revocation` workflows inside the Identity
Manager. Leaving these configuration blocks out of the respective config files will mean that each ENM listening server
will be created without SSL and default to the following ports:


* **Network Map** - 5050
* **Issuance (Identity Manager)** - 5051
* **Revocation (Identity Manager)** - 5052


### Client Side Enablement

Those ENM services which need to talk to other services as a client are configured similarly to the above, on a
per-service basis. For example, the Network Map is configured to talk to the Identity Manager thusly:

```docker
networkMap = {
    ...
    identityManager = {
        host       = localhost
        port       = 5050
        ssl = {
            <<< As configured above >>>
        }
    }
    ...
}
```

When SSL is enabled on the Identity Manager it must be set here. This will cause any connections made to the Identity
Manager to use the SSL credentials configured. Without these credentials, the Network Map side will attempt to
initialise an unencrypted connection, whilst the Identity Manager will be expecting an initial SSL handshake to occur,
resulting in an unsuccessful connection.


### Sharing SSL Settings

For some services, such as the Network Map, it is possible multiple SSL configuration blocks within the configuration
file. It is considered to be most secure if each of these connections use a unique set of SSL keys, however in some
situations it may be desirable to use the same SSL keys and certificates across multiple connections. To avoid
repetition within the config files and improve readability the SSL configuration block can be extracted out to a
separate file and then dynamically included within the config file. For example, the SSL settings below can be extracted
to the file `ssl-settings.conf`:

```docker
ssl = {
    keyStore = {
        location = /path/to/keystore.jks
        password = <key store and key password>
    }
    trustStore = {
        location = /path/to/trustroot.jks
        password = <key store password>
    }
}
```

and then included in the Network Map config file thusly:

```docker
...
enmListener {
    port = 20001
    ssl = include "ssl-settings.conf"
}
...
identityManager = {
    host       = localhost
    port       = 5051
    ssl = include "ssl-settings.conf"
}
revocation = {
    host       = localhost
    port       = 5052
    ssl = include "ssl-settings.conf"
}
```


## An Example

The following configuration files configure a small test deployment of the ENM suite of tools on a single machine.
This is why all of the services are binding to localhost and can refer to a central location for the PKI and
SSL certificates as well as the JAR files.
